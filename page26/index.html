        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>The USCCB recently released a <a href="http://www.usccb.org/comm/social-media-guidelines.shtml">working draft of their social media guidelines</a>, after receiving input from a variety of diocesan personnel. The draft includes general principles for social media use, a call to the development of diocesan-level policies, and quoted exhortations for proclaiming the Word online from Pope Benedict.</p>
<p>Here are some excerpts (my notes/highlights in bold):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social media are the fastest growing form of communication in the United States, especially among youth and young adults. Our Church cannot ignore it, but at the same time we must engage social media in a manner that is safe, responsible, and civil.</p>
<p>To keep members, a social networking site, such as a blog, needs to have new content on a regular basis. In the case of social media, the axiom &ldquo;build it and they will come&rdquo; is not applicable. <strong>It is important to set internal expectations regarding how often posts will be made [very good advice!]</strong>, so that your followers can become accustomed to your schedule.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define appropriate boundaries for communications.</li>
<li>Include examples of Codes of Conduct.</li>
<li>Provide recommendations on how to deal with difficult &ldquo;fans.&rdquo; <strong>[This is a biggie].</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also include instructions for networking with minors, personal websites, and how to report and monitor social networks. <a href="http://www.usccb.org/comm/social-media-guidelines.shtml">Read the whole document on the USCCB&nbsp;website &raquo;</a></p>
<p>A very good first stab at this ever-changing field of policy/law!<br />

          <a class="post-link" href="/2010/social-media-policies">Social Media Policies</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Before allowing personnel, students, staff, volunteers, etc. access to a public social media profile, or to become a blogger or online representative of your organization, it is a good idea to have a general social media policy, and to instruct everyone in its use.</p>
<p>Many Archdioceses and Catholic organizations (<a href="http://www.usccb.org/comm/social-media-guidelines.shtml">including the USCCB</a>) are starting to develop their own social media policies and guidelines, taking into account the need for online evangelization, the need for privacy, and the need for propriety in online relationships (especially with youth/minors).</p>
<p>Your social media policies should take into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that Pope Benedict XVI has called all members of the Church to proclaim the Gospel to the &#39;digital continent,&#39; especially via social media, blogs, and websites.</li>
<li>The need for people to relate to each other online in a very personal manner.</li>
<li>The need to protect trade secrets, privacy, and personal information.</li>
<li>The ability for people to post new information, pictures, and media from anywhere, any time.</li>
<li>The importance of the guidance of the Holy Spirit in online evangelization.</li>
<li>The fact that technologies and online communications are changing at a rapid pace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any policy that you create should be more of a &#39;living&#39; document, meaning that it is meant to change and morph over time as new communications technologies are invented, old methods of communication change or go away, and interpersonal relationships change.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/oscatholic/usccb-social-media">blog&nbsp;post on OSC with further reading and notes on the USCCB&#39;s&nbsp;Social Media Guidelines</a>. You can discuss social media guidelines in our forum, in <a href="/forum/topics/287">this topic on Social Media Guidelines/Policies</a>.</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I am looking for tips on how to select a Joomla template.&nbsp; I have found many websites that have them, some for free, and some for a fee.&nbsp; But they look pretty similar to me - how can I decide?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#39;t mind paying a nominal fee if for some reason it&#39;s better.</p>
<p>The template is for a church website.&nbsp; I want to be able to use my own banner, and to adjust the color scheme (if necessary) to match the banner.&nbsp; I want users who do not know html to be able to update the site, and I want to be able to limit which user can edit which page.&nbsp; I think those are all characteristics of any Joomla template, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m confused about how to decide which is best.</p>
<p>I have experience using Kompozer, writing html, and using CSS.&nbsp; I&#39;m less skilled with PhotoShop (but there are others on the team that are more experienced with it - the banner is being made by a graphic artist).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can tell, this is my first attempt at using Joomla.&nbsp; Any advice on selecting a template would be much appreciated!</p>

          <p>On July 1, it looks like two separate Archdioceses made announcements relating to online evangelization:</p>
<p>Archdiocese of St. Louis&#39; new <a href="http://archstl.org/webdev">Office of Web Development</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In July of 2010, seeing the need for an increasing presence online and in social media outlets, the Archdiocese of St. Louis has created a new office, the Office of Web Development, to help Archdiocesan agencies, affiliated organizations, and (eventually) parishes with their online development.</p>
<p>The Office of Web Development will work in especially close collaboration with the St. Louis Review and the Office of Communications in making sure news and newsworthy stories are delivered online to as many people as possible.</p>

<p>Archdiocese of Boston&#39;s <a href="http://www.bostoncatholic.org/catholicmedia.aspx">New Media &amp; Initiatives group</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRAINTREE &mdash; Embracing new and state-of-the-art forms of digital communication to reach the faithful has been a top priority of Cardinal Se&aacute;n P. O&rsquo;Malley.</p>
<p>As part of that effort, effective July 1, the secretariat for Catholic Media will be added to Cardinal O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s cabinet. Scot Landry, the current secretary for Institutional Advancement, will become the secretary for Catholic Media and oversee all of the archdiocese&rsquo;s print and digital media including The Pilot&rsquo;s print edition and its website, CatholicTV, the Boston Catholic Directory, Cardinal O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s weekly email, the archdiocese&rsquo;s website, the archdiocese&rsquo;s new media accounts including Facebook, Twitter and photo sharing.</p>

<p>Are there any other dioceses getting started (or already well-established) in these areas?</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p><img src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/magnifying-glass.jpeg" alt="Magnifying Glass" title="" style="float: right; width: 225px; height: 169px; margin: 10px;" />[<strong>Update</strong>: I now use Midwestern Mac, LLC’s <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/services/hosted-solr-search">hosted Apache Solr search for Drupal</a> to host Solr; it’s a lot easier than setting up (or even needing) a VPS for Solr.]</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://archstl.org">Archdiocese of St. Louis</a>, I manage more than 15 separate Drupal websites (plus a few others), and I have often wanted to use <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> for search across all these sites. I finally had some time to tackle this issue, and I have a pretty good (and very fast) Solr server set up, and this server is shared across all these sites on two (so far) different webservers through two different hosting companies.</p>

<p>The main Archdiocesan sites (<a href="http://archstl.org">archstl.org</a>, <a href="http://archstldev.com">archstldev.com</a>, and <a href="http://stlouisreview.com">stlouisreview.com</a>) are all hosted via SoftLayer in Dallas, while Catholic Youth Apostolate sites (like <a href="http://stlyouth.org">stlyouth.org</a> and <a href="http://www.cycstl.net">cycstl.net</a>) are hosted via Hot Drupal in North Carolina.</p>

<p>I was able to set up a linode (<a href="http://linode.com">linode.com</a>) for less than $20 to run Apache Solr via Jetty, and that server is then accessible to all our other servers to send and receive search index data. This solution allows our main web servers to keep resources free from expensive MySQL search queries and the large databases that result from storing 20k+ nodes’ search data in the main site DB.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://archstldev.com/node/319">the process by which I set up the search server in this issue</a> on the Development website. The best thing about this system is that I can really make the search server fly; ping takes about 30-40ms between the search server and our other servers, and queries only take about 150-250ms to reach the websites.</p>

<p>Any large organization looking to vastly improve search performance (and usability), especially on a Drupal site (it’s so easy, with the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/apachesolr">Apache Solr Search Integration</a> module pluggable right out of the box), should look into setting up a dedicated search VPS or server (depending on your search traffic).</p>

<p>Our linode Solr server typically sits close to idle, even at peak hours (right now it’s showing 0.00, 0.00, 0.00), and I’ll probably set it up to do some other tasks off-site as well, since it has the spare CPU, memory and disk space available (and a really fat pipe to the Internet!).</p>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>After reading <a href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1002362.htm">this article from the CNS</a> about a Massachusetts parish&#39;s use of its website, YouTube, Facebook, etc., it seems like they would be a good example of what to emulate in other parishes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Father Longe and parishioner Timothy Hourihan believe in taking the message of Jesus to new people in new ways. Specifically, during the past year they initiated many forms of electronic evangelization to attract more people to the faith.</p>
<p>Since April 2009, the parish YouTube site has had more than 20,000 views of its home-produced videos. The men have created a church blog, Facebook site and Twitter account, and have homilies, songs and prayers available for free downloads on iTunes.</p>
<p>The electronic offerings from the parish are a mix of education and entertainment. For example, one popular YouTube video involved Father Longe just standing in front of the parish statue of Mary and talking about the mother of Jesus.</p>
<p>Another video features Father Brian F. McGrath, St. Mary&#39;s pastor, cooking an Italian meal. The show follows him from the rectory garden to the kitchen to the dinner table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not just about the technologies&mdash;it&#39;s about how interested a parish actually <em>is</em> in using those technologies. It seems like Fr. McGrath (the pastor of St. Mary&#39;s) is being very helpful in this regard, encouraging parishioners to help him promote the parish online.</p>
<p>I think more parishes will take this approach in the coming years (especially those with younger parishioners).</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.stmaryswestfield.org/">St. Mary&#39;s parish website</a>; one thing I wish more parishes (including St. Mary&#39;s) would do is use a better content management system/strategy so they could wrap all their online offerings in one consistent website, rather than having a link to an offsite blog, a link to YouTube, a link to Facebook, etc...</p>
