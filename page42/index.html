        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I hear from many people involved in Diocesan and organizational work&nbsp;that they are interested in &quot;doing more things online&quot; and &quot;connecting&nbsp;with their members online.&quot; it's great to wish for these things, and&nbsp;even better to try to achieve them. But wouldn't it be nice to&nbsp;<em>actually</em> achieve these goals?</p>
<p>It's not the hardest thing to do. And it's not like&nbsp;technology is standing in the way and is extrememly hard to use... But&nbsp;time and time again, I see things done that hinder the Church's&nbsp;ability to truly communicate and connect with it's members online in&nbsp;the best way possible. One such incidence was the <a href="http://www.archny.org/news-events/columns-and-blogs/blog---the-gospel-in-the-digital-age/">start of a new&nbsp;&quot;blog&quot; by Archbishop Timothy Dolan</a> on the Archdiocese of New York's&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>The reason I put &quot;blog&quot; in parentheses is that this so-called blog&nbsp;could be compared to an eight cylinder engine firing on only four&nbsp;pistons; there are many things missing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There in no RSS or Atom feed to allow people to subscribe and receive&nbsp;automated updates of new blog posts (though there <em>is</em> a feed for each posts' comments... but seriously, which is more important???).
    <ul>
        <li>As an aside, once you have a feed, you also need to make sure you integrate it properly so there's not only an easily visible link or <a href="http://www.feedicons.com/">button</a> for it on the web page, but it's also appearing in the site's <a href="http://www.seoptimise.com/blog/2006/06/auto-discovery-rss-meta-tag.html">meta tags</a> so people using modern web browsers can subscribe easily in the standard way.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In the absence of a feed, there is no email list or any other method&nbsp;with which the diocese could &quot;push&quot; updates to the faithful.</li>
    <li>The main page of the blog doesn't even show the content!</li>
    <li>There's no way to promote, rate, or otherwise interact with the&nbsp;content - not even a &quot;post to Twitter&quot; link (though there are comments, so that's a plus).</li>
</ul>
<p>One positive aspect is that the 'blog' is incorporated into the rest of the Archdiocese of New York's website, so all the Google link power of the archny.org domain exists within the blog posts, something that doesn't happen for many groups who choose to host their blogs elsewhere (the highest profile blog I know of like this is the <a href="http://usccbmedia.blogspot.com/">USCCB Media Blog</a>, hosted on Blogger). Another positive aspect is the fact that the blog pages are well-formatted in terms of their html - using H2, &lt;p&gt;, etc. correctly :-)</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I'm guessing, and I'm pretty sure I'm right, that the blog is set up the way it is due to limitations imposed by whatever software suite (looks like ColdFusion) the Archdiocese of New York has running their website. If they were using a more easily extensible system, perhaps they would be able to do everything (including setting up specialized feeds besides simply a 'blog' feed) out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>That's why this website exists. I want everyone to know that producing a top-tier, beautiful, functional, fast, and user-friendly website is not only easy&mdash;it's <em>necessary</em> for the promotion of the faith! There is no excuse, in my mind, for the Church to drag her feet in this area anymore. Heck, <a href="/blog/oscatholic/bxvi-proclaim-gospel-digital-conti">even Pope Benedict has said the same</a>. We need to start doing things right, and do things right from the start!</p>
<p>Please help me in educating your (Arch)dioceses, being a good example of a Catholic who evangelizes and shares the faith both online and offline, and generously sharing your talents to the extent you're possible so our Church is not seen as being 'closed' 'guarded' and 'secretive.' It's usually not the Church's intention to be so, it's just a side effect of a lack of online savvy. Get your organization/Archdiocese to give some RSS feeds, if nothing else, so I can aggregate them on <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/">Catholic News Live</a> ;-)</p>

	<img align="right" alt="Catholic News Live RSS Feed Logo" height="150" hspace="10" src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/cnl-rss.png" vspace="10" width="150" />I recently launched a new news aggregator website, <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/">Catholic News Live</a>, which runs atop <a href="http://managingnews.com/">Managing News</a>, a Drupal-based feed aggregator. The site grabs about 50 different Catholic website and blog feeds every three-to-five minutes, and pulls all the stories into the main feeds page.</p>
<p>
	After that, I manually sort the stories into one of many different &#39;channels,&#39; which basically hold stories pertaining to a certain topic. The front page has it&#39;s own feed (with all aggregated stories), and each channel has a feed. In fact, you can even go to the Search page, search for a topic, then grab a feed for that topic!</p>
<p>
	There are a few highlighted searches already, but you can search for whatever you&#39;d like and save that as a feed (kind of like Google News&#39; daily email digest functionality, but more instantaneous).</p>
<p>
	All of this funcationality is built into Managing News (a great all-in-one solution, bye the way), and I&#39;m excited for what the future of the site holds. Right now I have all the &#39;News&#39; channel items feeding into the Catholic News Live Twitter feed (<a href="http://twitter.com/cathnewslive">@cathnewslive</a>) via HootSuite, but I may switch to using the Drupal Twitter module at some point (haven&#39;t decided how much I want to stick in the Twitter stream yet).</p>
<p>
	Does anyone want to help sort the news? At this point, it&#39;s just me, and it can get a little tedious ;-)</p>
<p>
	Also, if you see a feed missing, please comment on this post with a link, or find out how to get your feed added on the <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/node/1">CNL About pages</a>. You can also grab a badge to display whether your site is featured on CNL from the <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/node/98">badges page</a>!</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>From the Catholic News Agency:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vatican City, Oct 29, 2009 / 11:30 am (CNA) &mdash; Addressing the full Pontifical Council for Social Communications today, Benedict XVI urged its members to help communicate the teachings of the Church on the &ldquo;<strong>digital continent</strong>&rdquo; of the ever-changing technological landscape.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the role of social networking and increasingly real-time electronic communication, Pope Benedict XVI said on Thursday that &quot;modern culture is established, even before its content, in the very fact of the existence of new forms of communication that use new languages; they use new technologies and create new psychological attitudes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot;Effectively,&quot; he continued, the advent of new technology &ldquo;supposes a challenge for the Church, which is called to announce the Gospel to persons in the third millennium, maintaining its content unaltered but making it understandable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quoting John Paul II's encyclical &quot;Redemptoris Missio&quot; that affirms: &quot;Involvement in the mass media, however, is not meant merely to strengthen the preaching of the Gospel. There is a deeper reality involved here: since the very evangelization of modern culture depends to a great extent on the influence of the media.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not enough to use the media simply to spread the Christian message and the Church's authentic teaching. <strong>It is also necessary to integrate that message into the 'new culture' created by modern communications</strong>,&quot; the Holy Father asserted.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=17526">Continue reading [CNA] &raquo;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, what are we doing to &quot;spread the Christian message and the Church's authentic teaching? And, beyond that, how are we, as the Holy Father suggests, integrating our faith and the love of Christ into our (and others') online lives?</p>
<p>There truly is a 'digital continent,' and it is the 'new world' of our century. Can we venture out with the other explorers and evangelize to the inhabitants of this new world in an effective, loving way, as did the missionaries of years past, who risked their <em>very lives</em> to spread the faith?</p>
<p>I have seen many great examples of this happening - personalities such as Matthew Warner, Patrick Madrid, and Jeff Miller come to mind (along with a plethora of others), but what more can we do? How can we bring more people <em>outside the Catholic blogosphere</em>&nbsp;(and podcast-osphere) into the faith?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/2009/what-makes-a-good-parish-website">What Makes a Good Parish Website?</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I have been asked more times than I care to recall if I know of any good example parish websites, and, if not, what would make a good parish website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know of any parish website I would say is &quot;great.&quot; A couple &quot;good&quot; or &quot;okay&quot; ones, maybe, but nothing to call home and tell my Mom about. So, what are my criteria for a great parish website? One of which I would be proud to call myself a member?</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p><strong>The website must be pleasing to the eye</strong> (just like the Church <em>should</em> be). An ugly, or 90s-looking site, doesn&#39;t attract or hold my attention. It must follow the simple principles of design: color, appropriate use of negative space, a common theme, and good font design must all be taken into account.</p>
<p>Design also means the site is <strong>easy to navigate</strong>. It should have only a few main navigational options, and shouldn&#39;t be jumbled with a boatload of information on every page&mdash;and most especially the home page. (<a href="/blog/oscatholic/fear-apples-reducing-complexity">Read more on this topic</a>).</p>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p><strong>Know thy audience.</strong> What is the most important information for those coming to your website? Are you targeting your parishioners, or visitors, or both? Is the school website separate, or integral to the parish website?</p>
<p>WAY too many parish websites start with a cruddy &#39;splash&#39; page that takes a long time to load, looks stupid, and wastes my time. Give me the parish page by default, and let me click over to the school page if need be.</p>
<p>There are a few things which, in my mind, <strong>must be one every parish website&#39;s home page</strong>:</p>
<!--break-->
<ol>
<li>A picture of the parish (well-exposed&mdash;get a professional picture if possible). Don&#39;t make it huge or too overbearing, but incorporate it in the design.</li>
<li>Something that describes where the parish is located (in which (Arch)diocese).</li>
<li>Sunday Mass Times (every visitor needs to know this). Don&#39;t put ALL your Mass times - instead, put Sunday times, then a link to more Mass and Sacrament information.</li>
<li>Contact information (phone, fax, address).</li>
<li>Links (part of a well-designed navigation area) to:
<ol>
<li>Calendar of Events</li>
<li>Personnel information</li>
<li>Parish History (if possible)</li>
<li>Parish Organizations or Groups</li>
<li>Parish News / Pastor&#39;s Blog (NOT a copy/paste of the Pastor&#39;s homily... real news, please! You can also offer reflections, but save the homily for Mass)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, if your parish wants, you can add in the following to the mix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parish forums and/or bulletin boards (each parishioner could get a login)</li>
<li>Parish Bulletin (although the Parish news section should incorporate these items)</li>
<li>Schedule for ministers/ministries</li>
<li>Blogs, Podcasts, and Video Podcasts (especially relating to RCIA)</li>
<li>Photo galleries (either built into the site, or via a service like Flickr)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology/Back-End</h3>
<p>It is a minimum requirement that the site run on a CMS. I would suggest Wordpress for something relatively basic, Joomla for many medium sized parishes that don&#39;t want to do too many community features, and Drupal for any parish that wants to dive in and allow for an online community that&#39;s plays off of the physical, real community inside the Church.</p>
<p>Most parishes (if not all) don&#39;t need a dedicated server for this stuff. A $5/month HostGator account would serve everything up just peachy. I&#39;m running 7 high-volume websites off a $25/month Hot Drupal account (we&#39;re speaking 1-2,000 page views an hour). Most parishes get maybe 10-20 page views an hour, if that. Seriously.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>You can get even more advanced than what I&#39;ve described above. But I would like to see one site incorporate these features. Just one. Oh, and I&#39;d like it to look presentable. Show me that, and I&#39;ll send you a buck via PayPal. Mind you, this is just a parish website. School websites are a whole different ball of wax.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to be building out a sample site using Drupal for a local parish, and we&#39;ll see where that goes... but I&#39;d like to see the Church become a leader in this area. Too long have we trailed waaaaay behind our Protestant bretheren in this realm. I don&#39;t want cookie-cutter parish sites, either. I want online communities that allow for people in parishes to grow in faith and grow in love for Christ through the sites.</p>
<p><strong>Down with brochure sites! Down with Front Page!</strong></p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>For the past week (and the next), <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/special-sections/roma">I've been in the Eternal City</a>, helping the Redemptorist community stream their 24th General Chapter. They wanted to share the proceedings in a more immediate fashion with the broader Redemptorist community around the world, and this is probably the best way to do it.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I was approached by the Redemptorists' communications director and asked what kind of equipment he would need to take a live video feed from a multi-camera setup, and broadcast it on Ustream (free streaming = a good solution - you can also use Watershed or a similar paid service if you need it).</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/quick-and-dirty-ustream-multicam-setup.jpg" alt="Ustream - PC Solution - DV Bridge" width="525" height="394" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<p>I found a great little Analog-to-Digital converter from Canopus, the ADVC-55, and also purchased the ADVC-PSU5V AC Adaptor Kit with it (since the PC laptop the Redemptorists have has only a 4-pin/no-power FireWire port. I've used a variety of DV bridges in the past, and always had trouble with keeping a reliable DV stream into the computer. Luckily, the Canopus does a great job, and has not once caused a blip in the DV stream - it takes composite video in (along with audio, if need be), and converts it to a DV stream over firewire.</p>
<p>I didn't even have to install a driver on the Vista PC, as the DV stream acts as a generic DV-over-FireWire stream. Therefore, Ustream immediately recognized it and put it online.</p>
<p>For audio, we are using an output from the sound mixer, converted from XLR to 1/4" stereo minijack, and it sounds pretty good. You can easily control the volume of the signal either (a) at the board itself, or (b) using Ustream's volume slider. Note, however, that you should listen to the stream so you can see whether or not the sound is clipping. If it's clipping, you may need to use a different signal, or change the input on your computer from mic to line level.</p>
<p>This kind of setup works great for those who have in-house video systems, as it is probably the easiest way to convert analog video (composite, RCA-jack video, or S-video) into a usable source for Ustream, Watershed, and the like.</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>After reading Seth Godin&#39;s simple article on reducing complexity, entitled <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/10/fear-of-apples.html">Fear of Apples</a>, I felt compelled to write &nbsp;short piece about steps one could take to make users&#39; browsing experience that much nicer.</p>
<p>Basically, by reducing complexity and limiting people&#39;s options, you free them to (a) choose easier, and (b) remember what they&#39;ve chosen.</p>
<p>As a quick example, we start with the Archdiocese of Saint Louis&#39; current website, which gives users a metric ton of choices for navigation:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Archstl.org - Old Site" height="333" src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/archstl-old-options.jpg" width="550" /><br />
15 Navigation Options + Search + Quick Links</p>
<p class="rteleft">The way things are, people coming to the site for the first time have over 24 functional choices to make; it&#39;s not readily apparent what are the most important navigation options on the page.</p>
<!--break-->
<p class="rteleft">If we want to make things easier for people, we need to reduce the options&mdash;instead of 24 options, let&#39;s trim it down to 9 main options, with a small, differently-styled &#39;quick links&#39; section:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Archstl.org - New Site" height="334" src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/archstl-new-options.jpg" width="550" /><br />
5 Navigation Options + Search + Ads</p>
<p class="rteleft">In this new arrangement, it might have more graphic complexity, but the options are trimmed to such an extent, that it is (hopefully) easier for a user to choose where they would like to go.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Apple, love it or hate it, has done a great job (for some time) at simplifying people&#39;s options so they can &#39;make the right choice.&#39; Look at their computer lineups:</p>
<p class="rteleft">Consumer Macs:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacBook</li>
<li>iMac</li>
<li>Mac mini</li>
</ul>
<p class="rteleft">Professional Macs:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacBook Pro</li>
<li>Mac Pro</li>
</ul>
<p class="rteleft">Companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP, and Sony have a major problem&mdash;the same kind of problem most Church websites have&mdash;they have dozens of lines of laptops and desktops, with an arcane numbering system (6402bl??? seriously???), and people have no idea what to order, or what they <em>have</em> ordered. When someone asks, &quot;Do you like your computer? What model did you get?&quot; The answer is, &quot;Umm, something like a Dell Inspiron 660bl with the gaming option.&quot; If you ask a Mac user, the answer is: &quot;I have a MacBook.&quot; Which one will <em>you</em> remember?</p>
<p class="rteleft">Simplify, and it will not only increase customer/visitor satisfaction, but it will also help people become more familiar with your site and/or products.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Tell them what they want by giving them only the essential options!</p>
