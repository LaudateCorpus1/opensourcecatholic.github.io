	About the Book</h2>
<p>
	Drupal is one of the most respected and widely used open source content management frameworks. Small, medium, and large-scale websites are built using Drupal and the framework supports e-commerce, CRM, multisite and web service integrations.</p>
<p>
	Once you get your Drupal site installed and up and running, you will be concerned with site performance and how fast you can make your Drupal site run. This book will focus on implementing performance modules and solutions to help speed up your Drupal website.</p>
<p>
	We will look at introductory topics such as upgrading your Drupal site, maintaining your site, and enabling core Drupal page compression and caching.</p>
<p>
	Then we will turn to an advanced look at some contributed modules that help speed up performance, including Development, Boost, Authcache, Advanced Cache, and the Memcache API and Integration module.</p>
<p>
	Finally, we&rsquo;ll look at how best to implement a Drupal multisite environment and run it with high-speed performance in mind.</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>
	<strong>It is not good enough anymore to simply &#39;be present&#39; on the web, just as it is not good enough (nor was it ever good enough) to simply &#39;be present&#39; at Holy Mass.</strong></p>
<p>
	Catholics should make it a point to engage, to connect, and to assist others in their faith formation&mdash;online, at the mall, in the home, and at their Churches.</p>
<p>
	The Our Sunday Visitor issue from March 14, 2010 asks, &quot;<a href="http://www.osv.com/tabid/7621/itemid/6084/How-parish-websites-can-better-connect-with-Cathol.aspx">How effectively does your parish&#39;s website connect?</a>&quot; The answer to this question, for almost all parish websites I&#39;ve reviewed, is &quot;barely.&quot;</p>
<p>
	OSV gives some basic guidelines that should be met by every parish website (some of these are simply irrelevant or should be ignored, but at least most of them are good... my comments are in brackets):</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Avoid flash animation whenever possible. [<em>Note: This is not necessarily a great guideline, imo, but the intention is to avoid gaudiness... just like AVOIDING ALL CAPS!</em>].</li>
	<li>
		Be well-organized and easy to read with a top menu and a side menu [<em>could be one or the other, imo</em>] on the &#39;Welcome&#39; page [<em>I hate the idea of a &#39;welcome&#39; page - give us content, straight up, on the first page!</em>].</li>
	<li>
		Offer features that make it easier for people with disabilities to use [<em>sadly, most sites ignore this one... even the more appealing sites</em>].</li>
	<li>
		Include pictures of people, not just buildings, to show a sense of community. [<em>And, I would add, don&#39;t overload your site with pictures!</em>].</li>
	<li>
		Don&#39;t include advertisements [<em>parish websites are not a venue for generating revenue, but you can allow online donations</em>].</li>
</ul>
<!--break-->
<p>
	The OSV also offers content suggestions for parish websites; they say websites should feature (in addition to Mass times and bulletins):</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A mission statement that describes parish worship, life and community [<em>I fully agree on this one!</em>].</li>
	<li>
		Directions to the parish and contact information.</li>
	<li>
		An interactive parish calendar that can be updated by a variety of people [<em>Google Calendars is both easy and free, and integrates easily with any website</em>].</li>
	<li>
		Interactive forms that allow people to register for the parish as well as events... and sacramental forms that can be printed. [<em>This is a basic/easy functionality, and there is no reason why parishes still require tons of paperwork to be mailed all over the place, imo</em>].</li>
	<li>
		Password-protected &#39;Members Only&#39; section for committee members to share information, post updates and obtain feedback from others [<em>VERY easy to do if you use Drupal - just set up Organic Groups</em>].</li>
	<li>
		Online giving tools.</li>
	<li>
		A page for visitors. [<em>Umm, how about a whole </em>section<em>, complete with a &#39;We invite you to join our parish&#39; section? Maybe even a video from the pastor welcoming new members?</em>].</li>
	<li>
		A page for Catholics returning to the faith.</li>
	<li>
		Pages for the various age groups in a parish, with age specific content [<em>Even better if each section had a forum, group blog, etc... easy to do with Organic Groups.</em>]</li>
	<li>
		Podcasts or print versions of the Sunday homily. [I prefer both, but at least give a printed copy, perhaps on the Pastor&#39;s blog].</li>
	<li>
		Blogs, forums, prayer request page, etc. [<em>These community features can help integrate parishioners&#39; home lives with their at-Church lives, and strengthen a sense of community</em>].</li>
	<li>
		Bilingual content when appropriate. [<em>If you want this, use a CMS with good translation capabilities, like Drupal</em>].</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Did you notice I mentioned Drupal quite a bit in this post? If you think I&#39;m biased, well, I am. Drupal was practically built with parishes in mind! Out of the box, it supports different levels of memberships, a group blog, and multiple content types.</p>
<p>
	With extra modules, you can add interactive online forms, enable multiple &#39;groups&#39; under which people can post content and share information, and do almost anything under the sun.</p>
<p>
	And, best of all, <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> (and other Content Management Systems like it, including <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> (better for smaller sites) and <a href="http://joomla.org/">Joomla</a> (good for sites with a little bit less room for expansion)) is 100% free. It takes some getting used to, and it will take a developer to get things running (just like with any website project), but it is free to install, free to maintain, and free to upgrade. If you&#39;re going to invest in a website, make sure that you invest wisely!</p>
<p>
	I would also add to OSV&#39;s list that parishes should strive to involve themselves (even if it&#39;s just one of the priests, or a lay employee) in social media&mdash;Facebook, Twitter, FlockNote, or something else, if at all possible. If pastors truly want to &quot;meet people where they&#39;re at&quot; (a phrase I hear all too often), why are they so reticent to dive into the online community? Your flock is waiting!</p>

<p>
	I was just invited to the <a href="http://www.drupalgardens.com/">Drupal Gardens</a> private beta today, and I have to say, it&#39;s a leap forward in terms of building out quick, beautiful, and well-designed websites. But it takes things many, many, many steps further than a simple Wordpress or Blogger site.</p>
<p>
	Drupal Gardens is built with Drupal at its core, and every site instance you set up is basically an entire Drupal website (and it&#39;s completely exportable, so if your needs grow beyond the Drupal Gardens garden, you can re-plant on another server). This means you can have multiple users (with multiple permission levels). You can do relatively advanced theming, right out of the box (and without knowing too much about HTML, CSS, etc.!). You can set up multiple content types and set up specialized databases and queries. There are a thousand and one things you can do with DG much more quickly than by-hand.</p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	<img alt="Catholic Prayer Resource site - Drupal Gardens beta" class="imagecache-300px-by-300px" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/imagecache/300px-by-300px/user-uploads/oscatholic/catholic-prayer-resource.png" title="" /><br />
	From nothing to full site, in about 2 minutes.</p>
<p>
	There isn&#39;t a whole lot missing from Drupal Gardens. I think it will transform the way I approach smaller website design jobs - instead of working locally and starting from scratch, I might as well build out a Gardens site (collaborating with my clients, or whomever I&#39;m working with), then let the client take over and run with it.</p>
<p>
	Once Drupal Gardens is out of beta, expect to hear a lot more. I think this system could help a lot of parishes in a lot of ways&mdash;not the least of which is financially!</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>
	The Archdiocese of Saint Louis&#39; website has always had a very widely-used and useful prayer request functionality. Anyone in the world can submit a prayer request, and every prayer request is moderated and prayed for by contemplative sisters in the Archdiocese.</p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	<img alt="Old Prayer Center Form" class="imagecache-300px-by-300px" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/imagecache/300px-by-300px/user-uploads/oscatholic/old-prayer-request_1.png" title="" /><br />
	The old prayer request form</p>
<p>
	The website first had an online contact form, and all prayer requests were submitted by email. However, after some time, this got to be quite a burden (hundreds of requests were coming in every day!). The Archdiocese used a Joomla! component, <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/miscellaneous/religion/1988">PrayerCenter</a>, to handle the prayer requests for some time, with some custom modifications to speed up the workflow of moderating hundreds (some days, many hundreds!) of prayer requests. PrayerCenter is pretty good, but is not as modular and able to be customized as I would like.</p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	<img alt="Create Prayer Request Form" class="imagecache-300px-by-300px" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/imagecache/300px-by-300px/user-uploads/oscatholic/create-prayer-request.png" title="" /><br />
	The new prayer request form</p>
<p>
	The new <a href="https://palantir.archstl.org/node/add/prayer-request">prayer request form</a> (visible to end users) is highly optimized, and much more user-friendly. It limits the amount of characters in a prayer request, and using jQuery, shows the user how many characters he has remaining. Going completely custom allowed us to also tweak every last detail to our liking, meaning we didn&#39;t have confusing PrayerCenter branding here and there.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>
	PrayerCenter was working okay for a while, but every few months, when the number of prayer requests would hit something like 50,000, the request form would lock up (Prayer Center was not built to handle this kind of volume), and the database would have to be reset.</p>
<p>
	When the Archdiocese decided to rebuild its website in 2009, I had to ensure this prayer request functionality was present (first of all), but I also wanted to improve its usability and optimize the moderation process.</p>
<h3>
	Drupal CCK, Content Types, and Views: Building Blocks</h3>
<p>
	To begin, I set up a &quot;Prayer Request&quot; content type, and set it to have the following fields:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>First Name/Initials</strong> (this is the default &#39;Title&#39; field)</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Prayer Request</strong>: This CCK textarea field allows 750 characters, to make sure that prayer requests don&#39;t go on too long (our moderators don&#39;t have all day, you know!).</li>
	<li>
		<strong>&#39;Keep Private&#39;</strong> on/off checkbox</li>
</ul>
<p>
	By default, Prayer Requests are unpublished (this way nobody can see them except for the prayer request moderators.</p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	<img alt="Prayer Requests Page" class="imagecache-300px-by-300px" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/imagecache/300px-by-300px/user-uploads/oscatholic/prayer-requests.png" title="" /><br />
	The new prayer requests page</p>
<p>
	I then set up a view that does three things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<em>Shows a public listing of &#39;approved&#39; (i.e. &quot;Published&quot;) prayer requests</em>. Anybody can view this page here: <a href="http://archstl.org/prayer/requests">Prayer Requests</a></li>
	<li>
		<em>Shows a listing of all the prayer requests marked Private</em>. A volunteer summarizes all these prayer requests and sends that summary to the contemplative sisters for prayer. After the volunteer reads all the requests (she will check a box next to each one as she reads them), she uses <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views_bulk_operations">Views Bulk Operations</a> (VBO) to mass-delete them.</li>
	<li>
		<em>Shows a listing of all the submitted prayer requests that are unpublished</em> (ready for moderation). The moderator can click &#39;Publish&#39; next to the prayer request, or click in the body of the prayer request to edit it (using AJAX - I used the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/editablefields">Editable Fields</a> and the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/publishcontent">Publish Content</a> modules to enable this functionality).</li>

<h3>
	RSS Feed of Prayers</h3>
<p>
	Using Drupal&#39;s <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a>, it&#39;s pretty easy to create RSS/news feeds for whatever you want. We created a feed to go along with the Prayer Requests page, which shows <a href="http://archstl.org/prayer/requests/rss.xml">the last 40 prayer requests</a> posted to the website.</p>
<p>
	Using two of Drupal&#39;s most used modules (Views and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">CCK</a>, which is now built into Drupal 7), we&#39;ve replicated pretty much the entire core of the PrayerCenter module for Joomla... except this system can handle trillions of prayer requests before we&#39;ll even have to think about the size of the database!</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2010/archdiocese-of-saint-louis-upgraded-website">Archdiocese of Saint Louis' Upgraded Website</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>
	In early 2009, it was determined that the Archdiocese of Saint Louis needed to upgrade its website, mostly for security concerns. After investigating a move from Joomla 1.0.x to Joomla 1.5.x, the Archdiocese determined it would be more cost effective and a more future proof decision to migrate the over 49 individual Joomla sites that comprised www.archstl.org into a single Drupal installation.</p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	<img alt="Archdiocese of Saint Louis Website Upgrades" height="242" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/archstl-upgrade-screens.jpg" title="" width="650" /></p>
<p>
	This upgrade/migration provides many benefits, not the least of which are a better end-user experience, a better administrative experience, and much improved page load and search indexing performance. In addition, Drupal&#39;s structure and content presentation provide much greater flexibility in design and information structure, as well as SEO (search engine optimization) than other popular CMS frameworks that were investigated.</p>
<p>
	The decision was made early on to partner with a development company that would help with the content migration and initial site buildout. Theming would be done in-house. We chose to partner with <a href="http://www.palantir.net/">Palantir.net</a>, a web development company located in Chicago, IL. After Palantir completed initial site work, I went up to meet them, and also attended my first <a href="http://www.drupalcampchicago.org/">DrupalCamp (Chicago)</a>; Chicago has a much more vibrant Drupal community than St. Louis... but perhaps that will change at some point!</p>
<p>
	After nearly a year&#39;s worth of planning and development, the Archdiocese launched its upgraded website on February 22, 2010.</p>
<!--break-->
<h3>
	Server Configuration</h3>
<p>
	The Archdiocesan website was formerly running on a server managed through RackSpace, but costs and configuration restraints prevented us from continuing on a managed server through RackSpace. We migrated all of the Joomla sites to a new dedicated server from <a href="http://softlayer.com/">SoftLayer</a>, and also migrated a few of our other sites (including the <a href="http://stlouisreview.com/">Saint Louis Review</a> - <a href="http://drupal.org/node/429448">case study on Drupal.org here</a>). Due to caching and optimizations, the server is typically not burdened much, even with a few relatively high-traffic sites running on it.</p>
<p>
	The server is running the CentOS distribution of Linux, along with Apache, PHP and MySQL. Apache&#39;s configuration is set to survive a slashdotting, PHP is configured with APC caching for performance, and the MySQL configuration has been thoroughly tweaked to provide the best performance with the amount of RAM we have in the server.</p>
<h3>
	Modules Used</h3>
<p>
	Like any large website, this Drupal installation used a plethora of modules to enable certain functions and features. Here are some of the more relevant/prominent modules we used:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="http://drupal.org/project/joomla">Joomla to Drupal</a>: This module saved quite a bit of time and frustration when we were transferring all the content from the 40+ Joomla websites that made up the old archstl.org, and allowed us to easily add content from live site. The module was highly customized by Palantir to help import content directly into Organic Groups. (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/20975">agentrickard</a> did the lion&#39;s share of the work in moving all the databases - he should at least get a cookie for all that work!)</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://drupal.org/project/tw">Table Wizard</a> + <a href="http://drupal.org/project/migrate">Migrate</a>: Palantir helped immensely with regard to a ton of legacy data we use on our website to populate the Parish, Schools, and Organizations directories. Using Table Wizard and Migrate, plus a custom shell script (which runs every morning), we pull in data from various csv files, import them into Views-accessible tables, and then use Migrate to build a node for each organizational entity. (Special thanks to <a href="http://drupal.org/user/20975">agentrickard</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/146719">sdboyer</a> for setting this up).</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://drupal.org/project/custom_formatters">Custom Formatters</a>: Key to formatting a ton of content pulled from an Archdiocesan database. We used this module to set up formatters for phone numbers, Mass Times, and other miscellaneous data pulled into CCK fields.</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> + <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">CCK</a>: These two modules were used to build out almost the entire website. All content types use a &#39;body&#39; field provided by CCK (in Drupal 7, this is how nodes are built - there is no more &#39;Body&#39; attached to a node). The <a href="http://archstl.org/prayer/request-a-prayer">Request a Prayer</a> and <a href="http://archstl.org/commoffice/bulletin-gateway">Bulletin Gateway</a> system are both built on Views and CCK.</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://drupal.org/project/mapstraction">Mapstraction</a>: This module allowed for gratuitous use of Google Maps on nodes (using the Views attach module and node content displays), and in views (using a Mapstraction view attachment). (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/20975">agentrickard</a> gets another cookie for this).</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://drupal.org/project/date">Date</a> + <a href="http://drupal.org/project/calendar">Calendar</a>: The Calendar provides a very pleasing-to-the-eye listing of all the events posted to the website, and users can easily filter by group or event type using a Views exposed filter. The Date module supplies time/date functions for Event nodes and other features.</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://drupal.org/project/og">Organic Groups</a>: Each office and agency is set up as an organic group, with permissions for posting new news/blog posts, pages, forms (using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/webform">Webform</a>), and events. Additionally, each group gets its own menu, provided through the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/og_menu">OG Menu</a> module.</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://drupal.org/project/apachesolr">ApacheSolr</a>: After having many troubles with the large database (over 20,000 nodes, with about 800 words per node on average) with search indexing and cron runs, I decided to install ApacheSolr and the Lucene search server, then set up cron using the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/elysia_cron">Elysia Cron</a> module (to help ensure cron was running efficiently).</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://drupal.org/project/ubercart">&Uuml;bercart</a>: Online giving pages and the shopping cart system (with PayPal integration) are provided by &Uuml;bercart, along with a healthy dose of hook_form_alter()s and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rules">Rules</a>. (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/32095">johnalbin</a> setup most of our donation system, and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/36598">joelstein</a> helped with a lot of cleanup issues, including notification emails, some rules actions, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	SVN Version Control</h3>
<p>
	Working together with Palantir.net, I was finally forced to jump in headfirst into using a version control system. We decided to use SVN, and after I set it up on our Archdiocesan web server (running CentOS), we synchronized repositories with Palantir, then worked together (I did most of the theming, while Palantir did most of the back-end development and content migration), checking in and out quite frequently.</p>
<p>
	I tried to use Coda&#39;s built in SVN functionality, but ultimately had so many problems (it&#39;s in its early stages) that I decided to stick to using the Terminal to interact with the repository.</p>
<h3>
	Theming</h3>
<p class="rtecenter">
	<img alt="Archdiocese of Saint Louis Theme" height="412" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/Archdiocese-of-Saint-Louis.jpg" title="" width="500" /></p>
<p>
	Since I am very familiar with the internals of Zen 2.x (which was in an alpha release at the time I started site theming), I decided to build a Zen subtheme for this site. The archstl theme has a total of over 15 .tpl.php templates (I tried doing as much preprocessing as I could, but there are some structural XHTML changes that needed to be made directly in the templates), as well as 12 CSS files and a handful of javascript files.</p>
<p>
	The theme has a few main features:</p>
<h4>
	Mega Drop-Down Menu Navigation</h4>
<p class="rtecenter">
	<img alt="Mega Menus" height="299" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/mega-menus.png" title="" width="500" /></p>
<p>
	A trend that has become relatively popular of late, <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/mega-dropdown-menus.html">mega drop-down menus</a> provide the main navigation for the site. These drop downs are basically divs inside of a list of five main-level navigation links. The divs appear after hovering over a main link, and disappear a short bit after the mouse stops hovering. This functionality is provided via JavaScript.</p>
<p>
	Using mega menus has even allowed us to insert a parish search form directly into one of the menus. As this is one of the most frequently used features on the site, it should help save a little time for many users.</p>
<p>
	Due to restrictions in Drupal&#39;s menu system, I decided early on to simply create a custom php file with all the navigation markup, and then include that (using a php include) in the site&#39;s page.tpl.php templates. At some point, I might move this menu system into some sort of module, for easier management, but our main navigation doesn&#39;t change all that much, so it should be safe as-is for now.</p>
<h4>
	CSS3 / Progressive Enhancement</h4>
<p>
	Depending on what browser you use to view the new site, you&#39;ll either see rounded corners all over the place, of straight corners on edges of navigation links, sidebar blocks, and content items. Also, blocks should have beautiful box-shadows applied in any Webkit-enabled browser (newer versions of FireFox should also show the shadows).</p>
<p>
	The site was thoroughly tested in Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8, as well as FireFox 3+, Safari 4+, Opera 10, and Chrome 4+. Almost all of the main template is coded to meet CSS2 validation standards, and a glance at the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Farchstl.org%2F&amp;charset=%28detect+automatically%29&amp;doctype=Inline&amp;group=0">W3C Validator</a> (for the XHTML markup) provides an almost error-free review (the main pages seem to work well, but some legacy content has a ton of invalid cruft).</p>
<h4>
	Better Text Layout / Spacing</h4>
<p>
	The old site didn&#39;t give much thought to line-height, heading formatting, and text styling. The new theme contains styles for everything from blockquotes to list styles and every level of heading. It is much more pleasant to read a long page or article on the upgrade site.</p>
<p>
	Check out the <a href="http://archstl.org/commoffice/page/typography-test-page">Typography Test Page</a> (a great way to quickly make sure you&#39;ve styled the main elements).</p>
<h3>
	Other Features</h3>
<h4>
	Parish and School Search</h4>
<p class="rtecenter">
	<img alt="Parish Search Pages" height="279" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/parish-search.png" title="" width="475" /></p>
<p>
	The <a href="http://archstl.org/parishes">parish search pages</a> (along with <a href="http://archstl.org/schools">school search pages</a>) are set up using Views and the excellent <a href="http://drupal.org/project/mapstraction">Mapstraction</a> module (which allows us to use a view attachment to link a map to all the nodes listed in a view). (Read more about our <a href="/blog/archstl/drupal-views-filters-mak">custom views exposed filter handler</a>).</p>
<p>
	We set up a custom view with some exposed filters to sort <a href="http://archstl.org/commoffice/press-releases">Press Releases</a> and give an RSS feed for those who wish to follow the Archdiocesan news releases.</p>
<h4>
	Prayer Requests</h4>
<p>
	The Archdiocese of Saint Louis is privileged to have a wide variety of religious communities, and one of the beautiful things many of these communities have done is pray for thousands of online prayer requests since the beginning of the third millennium. Our online prayer request form has evolved from an email form, to Joomla&#39;s PrayerCenter, and finally to a fully-customized and highly-optimized feature on our new site. You can read more about&nbsp;<a href="/blog/oscatholic/free-alternative-prayerc">how we basically rebuilt PrayerCenter</a>, with tons of great improvements.</p>
<h4>
	Calendar System</h4>
<p class="rtecenter">
	<img alt="Calendar of Events" height="360" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/calendar-of-events.png" title="" width="400" /></p>
<p>
	The calendar system warrants a post on its own (I&#39;ll probably do that later), but using the power of CCK + Date + Calendar, you can make a calendar system that is infinitely extensible. Throw in Views and Organic Groups, and you have a magic combination.</p>
<p>
	On the old site, it was very hard to (a) manage calendar events (we used JCal Pro), and (b) integrate calendars into other content, and into each other. On the new site, since all events are simple event nodes with metadata attached, we can aggregate the nodes in so many different ways (besides the simple universal <a href="http://archstl.org/calendar">Calendar of Events</a>) to build a ton of different listings of calendar events&mdash;lists by taxonomy terms, month, year and day views, simple lists, and sortable and searchable event lists.</p>
<p>
	Another nice feature of the Calendar module is the ease of creating iCal-compatible calendar feeds. You can simply click the icon, and subscribe to the Archdiocesan calendars.</p>
<h3>
	Conclusion</h3>
<p>
	After almost a year of development, it is a wonderful feeling having a project like this out the door. There remain a lot of small tweaks, especially to content manager interaction, but things are much easier now that everything is unified into one codebase and database.</p>
<p>
	Moving forward, there are a ton of useful new features under development, and many of the current features will be further streamlined based on user feedback. I&#39;ll be posting more as the time comes!</p>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/2010/drupal-imagecache-display-alt-text-as-caption">Drupal ImageCache - Display Alt Text as Caption</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>
	While building the Archdiocese of Saint Louis&#39; website (launching Feb. 22, 2010), I needed an easy and quick way to <strong>allow users to caption images, without much hassle</strong>. On the old Joomla version of the website, users would have to upload an image, then insert it, then click on it, then click another button to add an image caption, set border properties, add padding, etc.</p>
<p>
	To cut through most of that mess, I set up an <a href="http://drupal.org/project/imagefield">ImageField</a> with Drupal&#39;s <a href="http://drupal.org/project/insert">Insert</a> module, which helps save a few clicks (and eliminates any need for users to navigate through directories and manage yet another set of files on the server itself&mdash;this approach is not altogether bad, but can be harder to teach to many people). But how to do image captions?</p>
<p>
	Easy! Just create an <a href="http://drupal.org/project/imagecache">ImageCache</a> preset that can be used by the Insert module when an image is inserted, and use a theme function (inside your Drupal theme&#39;s <strong>template.php</strong> file) to grab the Alternate text and convert it to a caption.</p>
<p>
<?php
/**
 * Add a caption to imagefield pictures with an 'alt' tag
 */
function archstl_imagecache($namespace, $path, $alt = '', $title = '', $attributes = NULL) {
  if ($path) {
		$attributes = drupal_attributes($attributes);
	  $imagecache_path = file_create_url(file_directory_path() .'/imagecache/'. $namespace .'/'. $path);
	  $output = '<img src="'. $imagecache_path .'" alt="'. check_plain($alt) .'" title="'. check_plain($title) .'" '. $attributes .' />';
	  $output .= '<div class="caption">'. check_plain($alt) .'</div>';
	  return $output;
	}
}
?></p>
<p>
	One downside to this approach is the fact that users won&#39;t be able to see the caption while they&#39;re editing the page... but I might figure out something to fix that, perhaps with a JavaScript plugin for the TinyMCE editor (we use the WYSIWYG module to set up editor profiles on the new site).</p>
<p>
	[UPDATE: This is not quite working for me right now... works great for imagecache-built CCK ImageFields, but not with inserted images... might have to resort to a JavaScript-only solution for the time being.]</p>
<p>
	The new Archdiocesan website will launch on Monday, February 22... stay tuned!</p>
