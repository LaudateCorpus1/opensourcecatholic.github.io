          <p>[<em>This post offers up some interesting topics for discussion &mdash; Ed.</em>]</p>
<p>As a faithful Catholic who embraces the Internet and the whole Web 2.0 &quot;movement,&quot; I am always amazed at how totally liberal and anti-religion many of the bright folks in this field are. Just today I was reading the great website TechCrunch, when I came across this <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/22/nsfw-say-what-you-like-about-the-google-books-kool-aid-but-it-tastes-much-better-than-microsofts-sour-grapes/">article by Paul Carr</a>, who wrote:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If this were a column about religious affairs, I would undoubtedly focus this week on the shocking news that Beelzebub himself has joined a coalition opposing child abuse in the Catholic church.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's clear that in Mr. Carr's mind there isn't the possiblity that one of the readers on his site might be a faithful Catholic who is offended by such a jab. Oh, well. Anticatholicsm is as old as the hills and the haters of the Church will always use the clergy sexual abuse scandal to slam the Gospel.</p>
<p>Any thoughts???</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2009/random-bugfixes-for-internet-explorer-6-7">Random Bugfixes for Internet Explorer 6/7</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>For the better part of two days, I was working on making a new design (currently <a href="http://www.archstl.org/new/front/">here</a>) for the <a href="http://www.archstl.org/">Archstl.org</a> website display correctly in Internet Explorer. There were a few bugs that took me hours to solve, so I thought I'd share here my solutions (note: 'good browsers = all browsers but IE').</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Archdiocese of Saint Louis final design screenshot" width="400" height="316" src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/archstl-new-design-final.jpg" /></p>
<p>Above:&nbsp;the final screenshot - I'll be working now mostly on little tweaks, and on porting this design to a CMS theme...</p>
<h3>The z-index property - fine in good browsers, bad in IE</h3>
<p>The first major problem I encountered was a bug in IE 6 and 7 - the 'mega menus' were appearing behind the jquery-enabled scrolling ads. I fuddled with z-index values quite a bit, and found a way to make the mega menus appear over the ads themselves, but the green arrow buttons were still appearing <em>on top of</em> the mega menus!</p>
<p>After a few hours of reading many different opinions of <a href="http://www.brenelz.com/blog/2009/02/03/squish-the-internet-explorer-z-index-bug/">IE's support for z-index</a> (or lack thereof), I finally found that the parent element of whatever div isn't being displayed correctly must also have a higher z-index than whatever you need to have appear behind it.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>So, for my example, I had a <code>div.popup</code> I wanted to appear above the rest of the page. I had to set <code>div.popup</code> and the <code>#header</code> div (which is the most senior parent-level div above div.popup) to have a z-index of something greater than the rest of the content, and also make sure that each element with a z-index property also has a <code>position</code> property set (such as relative, fixed or absolute).</p>
<h3>a:hover Background Colors &ndash; Where Art Thou?</h3>
<p>One of the simplest things in CSS, which almost always works perfectly across browsers, is the common set of <code>a:pseudo-classes</code>, such as a:hover, a:visited, a:focus, etc. &ndash; just use one of these selectors and put in a rule like &quot;background-color: red,&quot; and you're set to go.</p>
<p>For some reason, the a:hover rule <code>background-color: #FFF</code> wouldn't apply in IE6 for the main navigational tabs, even though it was perfectly fine in <em>every other browser</em>, and even though the 'color' rule worked in IE6. After much research (about half an hour on Google), I found a solution. You have to set a <code>z-index</code> and <code>position</code> property to the element you want an a:hover background color change on, because, apparently, the background color is changing <em>behind</em> the a:hover element's parent div! Quite ridiculous, if you ask me.</p>
<h3>Crossing the Borderline</h3>
<p>IE6 always has a funny way of handling borders. Especially in more complex layouts with lots of floats. One bug I often encounter is when IE6 decides to chop off the top and/or bottom borders on a block element. The tabs render fine (with a 1px border) in all other browsers, but look like someone grabbed a precision knife and simply sliced off one pixel of border. To overcome this, I used an IE6-only stylesheet and added the rule:</p>
<pre>
ul#primary-links li.parent a.parent { /* added to allow background color on rollover */
	position: relative;
	z-index: 100;
	border-top: 2px solid #64110a; /* Because 1px border gets lost */
	margin-top: -1px; /* To correct alignment of 2px border */
}</pre>
<p>(The two rules at the top were for the :hover bug mentioned previously). Instead of trying to fix the matter outright, I decided to simply throw my hands up and make the border a whopping TWO pixels in IE6, and then pushed the tabs back up one pixel (with a negative margin) to compensate for the extra pixel of (now-visible) border space.</p>
<h3>The Moral of the Story</h3>
<p>Track your website visitor stats, and see what browsers are most commonly used. This site, as well as a couple of my other more tech-inclined sites, has only 1-5% of its visitors using IE6. However, <a href="http://www.archstl.org/">Archstl.org</a> has a much older audience on average, as well as a large corporate audience, meaning IE6 users take up somewhere between 15-25% of the overall site visitors. This stat will change, but for now, this means I can't ignore developing (and hacking, and bugfixing) for IE6. &lt;/groan&gt;</p>
<p>If you are, like me, unfortunate enough to have to develop for this antiquated and horrible browser, Google is your friend &mdash; do searches for &quot;explorer 6 bug &lt;your problematic css element here&gt;.&quot; There's a plethora of information about how to fix oh-so-many problems... and it's often not <em>quite</em> as hard as you'd think.</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I don't know how many times I've now been contacted about building custom Church websites for various parishes, organizations, and ministries... and most of the time I am unable to accept these requests. I think our Church is finally at the point where the greatest hurdle is not necessarily pastors/leaders misunderstanding the importance of a good web presence, but the lack of great tools for building that presence.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Ugly and not so ugly websites." width="595" height="252" src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/geerlingguy/ugly-websites-parishes.jpg" /></p>
<p>I've seen site-building services such as www.eCatholicChurches.com, www.CatholicChurchWebsites.com, and www.ChurchAddress.com, but <strike>have a few problems with them</strike> (note: please read through the comments below this post for some good discussion about the issues at hand):</p>
<!--break-->
<ol>
    <li>The expense of running a website through one of these services &mdash; it often costs $30-80/month! A lot of parishes simply can't devote $500-1000/year to a website.</li>
    <li>The need... <em>still</em>... for a parish 'webmaster' (someone to update the content).</li>
    <li>The lack of any kind of recognition by the Church; <strike>I can't even tell if there are any Catholics affiliated with these organizations.</strike>&nbsp;(Again, see responses below). Do they truly have what's best for the Church in mind, or are these sites simply trying to make as many dollars as they can and taking parishes for a ride?</li>
    <li>The sites often are very 'cookie-cutter-esque,' and are not very well made for searchability, accessibility, and usability.</li>
</ol>
<p>Granted, many parish websites are horribly bad when they are set up for free by some self-assigned parish 'webmaster' (I really dislike that term; seems so early-90s!), and the aforementioned services are leaps and bounds better than the ugly animated-GIF-infested parish pages. But I think we can do better.</p>
<h3>Parishes as Communities of Faith</h3>
<p>If parishes are truly supposed to be devoted and faithful communities in real life, why can't we turn that community-mindedness over to parish websites as well? And can't we find a way to help parishes&mdash;many with little to no budget for a website&mdash;have some sort of parish community site?</p>
<p>Essential features would be:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A calendar of events; anyone can add an event, and the event can be approved by whomever the parish designates with that authority.</li>
    <li>Organization/Ministry pages; able to be updated (news stories, calendar items) by whomever is in that parish organization or ministry.</li>
    <li>Pastor's Blog (and associates, if need be); able to be easily updated by the Pastor, and with podcast capabilities if he so chooses. Comments can be on or off. RSS feeds are a <em>must</em>.</li>
    <li>An informational page, with Mass times, contact info, and other Sacrament times (ideally, this page would also automatically generate an XML or JSON file which sites like <a href="http://www.flocknote.com/">FlockNote</a> and MassTimes could use to automatically update their databases.</li>
    <li>Easily buildable online forms - for registration, baptism, etc.</li>
    <li>Donation systems (or an integrated donation system for Archdioceses) &mdash; able to use PayPal, eAuthorize, or some other standard and trusted system.</li>
    <li>Photo Galleries &ndash; parishioners might be able to upload their own photos from parish and school events to share with others.</li>
    <li>(Possibly:) A way to integrate a school website... although school websites are a whole different beast, in many ways.</li>
</ol>
<p>To set up one website like this, using Drupal, would take a few hours at least, and then a few more for a custom theme. However, if we were to make a Drupal installation profile (like the <a href="http://openatrium.com/">Open Atrium</a> project does), we could have a quick and easy site setup for multiple parishes, and the only concern would be hosting and bandwidth... which I would hope (Arch)Dioceses, and possibly also bishop's conferences, could help pay for.</p>
<p style="width: 450px; text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="Open Atrium Sample - Calendar Screen" width="400" height="344" style="padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #999;" src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/geerlingguy/open-atrium-example.jpg" /><br />
Open Atrium is a project management system / Intranet powered by Drupal and is very easy to set up using an installation profile.</p>
<p>With Drupal, we could maybe set up one server/VPS for each (Arch)Diocese, and have a Drupal multisite installation, with a site for each parish (if nothing else, you could set up something like parish-name.archdiocese.com for each parish).</p>
<p>Any takers? If not, I will keep this on my back-burner for a while until I get more time to work on it ;-)</p>

<ul>
    <li>Do I get a vendors license, do I incorporate, or do I just report the extra income on my personal taxes???</li>
    <li>What program do you use to do your invoices? (I've found some descent invoice templates for OpenOffice 3)</li>
    <li>Do you list the web hosting in your own name, or do you put it in your client's name and let them take care of the hosting themselves (after you have set it up for them?)</li>
