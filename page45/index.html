          <p>Hello, friends.</p>
<p>I'm writing my undergraduate thesis on the Church's need to utilize new media. Exciting, eh? You may be interested in:</p>
<p>- Case Studies: I'm seeking some parishes and ministries who are using, have used, or are planning to begin using new media.</p>
<p>- Literature Search: Got some great bookmarked links on the Church + new media? Sharing is caring.</p>
<p>- Literature Collection: I'd love to know if there are any &quot;libraries,&quot; directories or collections of links to articles about the Church and new media. If a place like this doesn't exist, I definitely think it should. Anyone interested in this type of a project, do get in touch with me.</p>
<p>Do contact me if any of the above interest you, or if you'd like to contribute your &quot;2 cents&quot; to my writing. I would eventually like to publish this piece as a resource.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>

          <p>I just found a great little PHP utility called <a href="http://milianw.de/projects/markdownify/">Markdownify</a>. &nbsp;It provides a good PHP&nbsp;solution&nbsp;for those times when you want to convert HTML into plain text. &nbsp;For example, I often have clients who create newsletters through a WYSIWYG interface, and Markdownify can create the plain text version very easily. &nbsp;My current use for it is converting the HTML description of an event from an online calendar into plain text for use in an iCal feed.</p>
<p>In case you've never heard of Markdown... it's a plain text formatting syntax, which is very easy to read by itself, and which can be easily converted into HTML. &nbsp;Check out how it works <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">here</a>. &nbsp;There's a PHP&nbsp;version <a href="http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/">here</a>.</p>

<p>If a picture speaks 1000 words, what does that say about video?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the web development shops in my area also do video production, ect.&nbsp; With some online newspapers even producing video, has web development gotten to the point where just text isn't enough without audio and/or video? &nbsp;</p>

          <p>Hit the Apple store at Ridgedale around 11am this morning. Place was packed. Line for Snow Leopard was about 5 deep but moving pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Grabbed Subway, then to the home office to do some loading.</p>
<p>I thought I read somewhere that's it's a 15-20 minute upgrade...uh uh. Took almost an hour. While I was waiting, I putzed around on my XP machine while watching the Macbook out of the corner of my eye.</p>
<p>After a few reboots...upgrade complete.</p>
<p>I haven't really tried anything yet, but I did note shutdown and startup times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shutdown - 5 seconds (no open applications)</p>
<p>Startup - 75 seconds</p>
<p>It's possible that the first shutdown/startup sequence may still be shuffling some bits and in the future it'll be even faster...but I'm pleased. Opening up applications seem a bit snappier.</p>
<p>I've got a 17&quot; MacBook Pro (2008 model), 2.5 Ghz Intel Dual-core with 4GB of RAM. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to trying out the Exchange Server integration, see if it actually works. I've been dropping into Parallels to run Outlook 2007...and even though it's bearable running a VM, I'd prefer not to.</p>
<p>Anyone else moving to SL?</p>

          <p>I came across an interesting problem in the blogosphere yesterday.&nbsp; Patrick Madrid wrote <a href="http://patrickmadrid.blogspot.com/2009/08/my-response-to-sr-maureen-fiedlers.html">this blog</a> about a gushy article on Sen. Ted Kennedy's passing.&nbsp; A blog commenter(who apparently often posts on his site not in a malicious way)&nbsp;uses the username &quot;Patrick&quot;&nbsp;and claimed that he doubted that Sen. Kennedy repented of his pro-choice politics before death.&nbsp; Other users and some of the Media 1.0 crowd apparently attributed the comments to Patrick Madrid who's username is &quot;Patrick Madrid&quot; and rebuked him for it.&nbsp; Patrick Madrid clarified it was not him, but I&nbsp;can see this being a tricky situation.&nbsp; What is the best way to handle commenter usernames?&nbsp; Just let it fly or does the blog writer need to make sure they are not being impersonated.&nbsp;I guess another question that comes up from here, is how to prevent malicious commenters who post obscenely or who personally attack others?</p>

          <p>Hello everyone! &nbsp;I finally joined (at Jeff's persistent urging). &nbsp;I'm excited to meet other Catholics who share the burden of building websites. &nbsp;I've been a web developer since 2002, and besides a short job I took after college, I've been working for Catholic companies doing web development ever since, and I've always been the only &quot;web guy&quot; around. &nbsp;This site is a good idea to connect all of us.</p>
<p>However, I'm a little confused &mdash; there seems to be too many ways to share and discuss on this site than my brain can compute: articles, wiki entries, blog posts, website posts, and forum posts. &nbsp;Where do I start?</p>
<p>I see the site is still &quot;beta&quot;, and Jeff said that's because he's not sure about all those content types, either. &nbsp;I think limiting to blog and forum entries would probably suffice. &nbsp;Write a blog entry if you want to share some interesting technique, insight, or success story (combining blogs, articles, and websites), and write a forum post if you just want to ask questions and gab.</p>
<p>What does everyone think?</p>

          <p>&nbsp;OK...there hasn't been any new content in 27 hours. Not cool. I'll stop complaining and post something.</p>
<p>After having been on PC's for almost 12 years, I switched back to Mac a couple months ago. A long time ago in a previous career (audio engineering) I used Mac's quite a lot. Actually, the first time I plunked down my own hard earned cash for a computer it was $900 for a Mac Classic. Something like 30 MB of storage. Ouch. Still had THE COOLEST GOLF GAME EVER. It had really lo-fi birds chirping, but that 8-bit 'swoosh' of the golf club rocked. When I'd be working the recording studio with it, that golf game was a huge hit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm digressing...</p>
<p>So I switched 'back' to Mac...whatever that means. Over the past 18 years I've worked on Win, Mac, *nix, Cisco/Nortel IOS...etc. Heck, I even loaded up BeOS once.</p>
<p>Long story longer...</p>
<p>One of my most valuable apps on the PC was a shareware app called RoboForm. It kept all my logins and passwords in a nice tidy encrypted file and would populate forms and save them on the fly. It rocked! Sure, you can get by on a txt file...but that get's unwieldy after awhile.</p>
<p>When I got my MacBookPro I started looking for something similar. Yes, I know about KeePass...the OpenSource alternative. I just never dug it...don't remember why either. But hey, some people love it, that's great. Well, after not having much luck...</p>
<p>...I found 1Password&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password</a></p>
<p>Really liking it. It'll even sync up with my iPhone.</p>
<p>So, I'm happy.</p>
<p>How about you? How do you handle 5,10,50,100+ account passwords?&nbsp;</p>
