<p>[I set up <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/united-states-conference-of-catholic-bishops-open-up-access-to-the-nabre-and-catechism">this little petition</a> just to allow people to voice support. Petitions don’t help change things in the Church, but it’s good to see what kind of things people would like to see happen!]</p>

<h3>Correspondence with USCCB about licensing/access</h3>

<p>I have contacted the USCCB twice now, asking once on behalf of the Archdiocese of St. Louis (I used to work there as Director of Web Development), and once on behalf of flockNote, Open Source Catholic, and Midwestern Mac. Both emails asked a simple question: Is there any way I could get access to the<strong> only</strong> USCCB-approved biblical translation and CCC translation so I could use these translations in mobile apps and websites?</p>

<p>I was hoping to see if they would offer the works under some sort of free license that would allow Catholic developers the ability to build apps including Catholic bible texts and CCC integrations (something like the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/westminster-shorter-catechism/id357433595?mt=8">Westminster Shorter Catechism in 90 Days study guide app</a>, but for Catholics). But the responses I’ve received have been less than encouraging—see the forum topic <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/forum/topics/84#comment-1822">Public Domain Catholic Bibles</a> for the full details.</p>

<p>The gist of their responses: They have things ‘in the works’, and anyone can get the bible and CCC on Kindle (‘for a low price…’), and they’re working to allow brief excerpts (but definitely not a whole chapter or section) to be emailed to people.</p>

<h3>Current Access to Catholic Catechisms and Bibles</h3>

<p>Currently, there’s a $17 Catechism for the Kindle (where the paperback version is $9), as <a href="https://twitter.com/brandonvogt1/status/149189090997309441">mentioned by @BrandonVogt1</a> on Twitter. He appropriately tagged that with the #EvangelismFail tag… why is this not free in eBook format, at a minimum?</p>

<p>And the ONLY canonical source for these texts is the USCCB website, which is still set up like a 90s era website, with a link structure by which people can access any book of the bible, or chapter, but there’s poor/no search ability, and it’s hard to actually discover topical information, or find particular topics or indexes of either the Bible or the Catechism on the USCCB’s website.</p>

<p>There are a few companies who have paid (large?) licensing fees to the USCCB to use the official translations in their software and websites—one in particular is the <a href="http://www.logos.com/product/9355/new-american-bible-rev-ed">Logos bible software</a>, which charges $17 on top of the fee for their software for access.</p>

<h3>Resolution</h3>

<p>The most helpful thing the USCCB could do is allow completely free and open access to the texts of both the NABRE and CCC by anyone. But as I see this is quite unlikely to happen (but I’d be very happy to be surprised!), I think something like the following could be more amenable:</p>

<p>The USCCB could have a NABRE/CCC API available to developers—could be something simple like JSON or something—and developers could send a request for, say, CCC #2150, and their API would return the contents of that section.</p>

<p>To gain access to this API, a developer would simply need to register an account and authorize access, getting a token in the process that would allow them to request up to one chapter of the bible at a time, and one section (or a group of sections) from the CCC at a time.</p>

<p>If the API tracked calls, then developers would be allowed a certain number of calls per day for free; any more than that, and the developer would need to pay some small fee per month/quarter/year.</p>

<p>Developers could cache the results of API calls for a certain period of time—say, 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month—so their apps and sites would be able to run faster. But data would need to be refreshed to ensure the integrity of the translation, including any textual updates.</p>

<p>I don’t know if this is going to happen, and I don’t think it will, but I pray that this might possibly be considered someday. (<a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/oscatholic/what-if">I’ve talked about this before</a>, but got no traction).</p>

<p>If I, as a Catholic developer, have to continue to use old English translations of the Bible from the Vulgate, or the King James Version (not even Catholic!), I’m at a major disadvantage. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free">Information wants to be free</a>—and right now, some of the fundamental parts of our faith are locked up under strict licensing restrictions.</p>

          <p>I used to work in the <a href="http://archstl.org/">Archdiocese of St. Louis</a> as the director of Web Development, so archstl.org (and other online Archdiocesan properties) are near and dear to my heart. I spent countless hours <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/oscatholic/archdiocese-saint-louis-upgraded-website">merging some 49 Joomla websites into the Drupal install</a> that (still) runs archstl.org, and besides a bunch of database heavy lifting that was outsourced, I bled over almost every feature on the site (I’ve chronicled many experiences on this site in the past).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://archstl.org/"><img src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/Jeff%20Geerling/archstl_org_redesign_blue.jpg" alt="Archdiocese of St. Louis archstl.org redesign - blue" title="" width="500" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>So, I’m very happy to see that the Archdiocese has continued to develop and improve the site. This new design has a more modern and ‘edgy’ feel, and is the first redesign to involve more theming and work on the ‘View’ of the website rather than a complete rearchitecting of the database, filesystem, etc.—which is awesome!</p>

<p>I wish other Catholic organizations I’ve worked with were in the position of not having to scrap their website and redesign from scratch every few years… I’ve seen too many projects where an organization will spend thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, and end up with a site that’s not very future-proof, and will again be scrapped and redesigned for much more $$$ in a few years. Don’t be that organization :)</p>

          <p><em>Before I get started, I want to make it <strong>abundantly clear</strong> that I am in no way ripping on <a href="http://catholichotdish.com/">Catholic Hot Dish.com</a> in this post—I simply wanted an example for illustration, and this is one site that follows a design pattern I’ve seen on many Catholic sites. I enjoy Catholic Hot Dish, and am saying nothing of the blog or it’s content—simply it’s design choices…</em></p>

<p><img src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/Jeff%20Geerling/tons-of-share-links.jpg" alt="Catholic Hot Dish Share Links" width="144" height="500" style="float: right; margin: 5px;" />Now that that’s out of the way, I wanted to point out an alarming trend I’ve seen on many new Catholic websites, parish websites, diocesan websites, and blogs: the tendency to pollute the entire design with too much ‘stuff’ that distracts from the website’s actual content (what readers want to see).</p>

<p>Since I often read things in my RSS reader or Instapaper, it’s not a huge deal to me—I click one button and the overpowering design of a site vanishes—but it is a problem for many of your site’s readers, who aren’t tech savvy enough to use such services. It’s especially troublesome if you don’t have a mobile-optimized design (or if your mobile-optimized design doesn’t actually provide the bits of information that are actually important and present in your ‘full’ design).</p>

<p>The worst case is a design that has too many design elements and doesn’t have a mobile-optimized version, meaning a mobile device may be loading 1-2MB worth of resources over a 3G connection, <em>just to read your article</em>!</p>

<h3>Sharing Too Much</h3>

<p>There seems to be a tendency to push the ‘share’ links—and to push them <em>hard</em>. It’s now normal to see a set of Facebook, Twitter, Google+, ShareThis, etc. links in not one, but three to five (or even MORE) places on a particular page.<!--break --></p>

<p>In the example of Catholic Hot Dish, there are post-sharing buttons above and below the post (1 &amp; 2), there’s a sitewide ‘stay connected’ set of links at the top right (3), there’s a Google+ widget (4), there’s a Facebook fan page widget (5), there’s a Twitter widget (6), and an extra set of two (redundant) share widgets at the bottom of the page (7 &amp; 8).</p>

<p>Not only do all these widgets cause pages to <strong>load more slowly</strong> (in the case of CHD, probably about 3-4x longer than if all those widgets were gone—they make up more than half of the page size, and add about 60-100 requests per page), they also clutter the design and make it <strong>less likely someone will share something</strong> (because there are too many ways to do it!).</p>

<h3>Overemphasis Causes Distraction</h3>

<p>It’s a bit like the sign-emphasis syndrome I encounter quite often when helping Catholic organizations with advertisements and campaigns, especially for printed material or graphics.</p>

<p>People have a tendency to overemphasize to the point of distraction:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/Jeff%20Geerling/overshare-event-ad-too-bold.jpg" alt="Biggest Event ugly ad" title="" width="300" height="203" /></p>
<p>Notice how, in the image above, even though we emphasize almost everything in the ad, nothing really stands out (well, maybe the title, but that’s it).</p>

<p>There are two things you need to do to make sure you hit people where it counts and make them want to do what <em>you</em> want them to do (on your website, in an ad, on a flyer, etc.):</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Take away the cruft.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Highlight only what's <em>really</em> important.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3>An Example of Minimal Web Design</h3>

<p>I’ve been focusing on the idea of ‘distractionless’ web design for the past few years, and I recently rebuilt <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/">Catholic News Live</a>’s website to try to cut out even more distraction from the site. I had to do a few things to get to the point where I am now:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Focus on the features I want people to use:</li>
<ol>
	<li>Reading the latest news stories.</li>
	<li>Finding/purchasing the Catholic News Live mobile app.</li>
</ol>
	<li>Cut out everything that doesn't help with (1):</li>
<ol>
	<li>I took out all the ads on the site (they weren't really generating revenue anyways).</li>
	<li>I took out all sidebar and footer information except for links to the mobile app (and a couple 'follow/like' buttons).</li>
	<li>I distilled the list of the latest news down to the fewest functional elements.</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/Jeff%20Geerling/cnl-website-design.jpg" alt="Catholic News Live website design" title="" width="600" height="174" />
Catholic News Live... before and after a makeover.</p>
<p>Nothing I took away made the site harder to use, or less functional—rather, it made the website faster to load (average page load times are down 30%, and the page size is halved), and made the relevant functionality of the site easier for end users to grasp and use.</p>

<h3>Make some Changes</h3>

<p>Look at the sidebars, widgets, links, and modules/plugins your site is currently using. Do you really need a ‘ShareThis’ link in addition to Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ share links, or can you just get by with one or two of those links?</p>

<p>Do you really need that 3D cloud of tags that fly around the mouse when you hover over them?</p>

<p>Do you really need an image rotator that shows the latest pictures you took on a family vacation?</p>

<p>Think about the actual utility of every element of your website, and whether it is essential to your site’s functionality, or whether it may be distracting and paralyzing to your website’s usability.</p>

<p><em>Take away the cruft. Keep only what’s important.</em></p>
