          <p>Lately there have been a few new job opportunities for Catholics who are in the tech realm and/or are looking to work with social/new media. Here are two I’ve heard about in the past week:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://brandonvogt.com/love-social-media-the-usscb-has-a-job-opening-for-you/">USCCB Social Media Specialist</a></strong>
For someone who loves the Church, can use social media tools effectively, and wants to help Cardinal Dolan figure out his iPad.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.flocknote.com/jobs">Flocknote Happiness Engineer &amp; New Media Product Sales Specialists</a></strong>
For people who like to help other people and teach others how to use new communications tools effectively.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m happy to see that some dioceses and parishes are starting to really get on board with social media and a more potent online presence—there are a few dioceses who finally have full-time online representatives and incorporate online content strategy in communications and marketing campaigns!</p>

<p>Know of any other openings? Leave the info in the comments below.</p>

          <p>Ever since building <a href="http://archstl.org/mobile-app">Catholic STL</a>, an iOS app for the Archdiocese of St. Louis, and then generalizing the code to produce the <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/Catholic-Diocese-App-iOS">Catholic Diocese App for iOS</a>, I’ve wanted to develop a version for Android.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/Jeff%20Geerling/jesuit-app-locations-screenshot.png" alt="Jesuit App - Locations - iOS" title="" width="200" height="300" />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/Jeff%20Geerling/jesuit-app-news-andoid.png" alt="Jesuit App - News - Android" title="" width="169" height="300" /></p>

<p>A few months ago, the Jesuit Conference contacted me, and finally gave me the ability to do this. Not only was I able to build the <a href="http://mobile.jesuit.org/">Jesuit App</a> for iOS and Android phones (Android version will be on Google Play soon!), but I was able to generalize the code from the Android version to post the <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/Catholic-Diocese-App-Android">Catholic Diocese App for Android</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll be cleaning up some documentation here and there in the coming months, and I invite any other developers interested in helping to do so—all of the source code and documentation is available on GitHub (links below), and you can follow along with the latest news on the project page: <a href="/project/catholic-diocese-app">Catholic Diocese App</a>.</p>

          <p>A year ago, I registered the domain <strong>catholiccrossreference.com</strong> after my previous web site suffered a meltdown. This domain became the new home of my Catechism search engine (among other things).</p>

<p>Today, I am announcing the release of a Catechism API (still in beta).  There is no documentation written for it yet, although the field names (and their values) are pretty straight-forward.</p>

<p>This API allows you to request information about the sections of the Catechism and to search the text of the Catechism by word or Scripture reference.  In the near future, there will be both documentation and a sample display of how to render the JSON results in HTML.</p>

<p>There are 25 beta accounts available… probably highly optimistic on my part.</p>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/2012/usccb-announces-browser-based-ebook-catechism">USCCB Announces 'Browser-Based eBook' Catechism</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>This morning, the USCCB <a href="http://usccb.org/news/2012/12-107.cfm">announced</a> the release of a new Catechism of the Catholic Church as an eBook. My hopes that this was finally true were dashed when I found two problems:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The "Browser-Based eBook" is not an eBook—it's the same thing that's <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM">been available on the Vatican website</a> for years, just with a search bar at the top and without a parchment background.</li>
	<li>The actual ePub Catechism is still $10.</li>
</ol>

<p>The ePub file costs very little (in terms of infrastructure) to download—probably a penny or less per download. The hard-copy book costs $16… but some of that cost (if not all) is justified by the fact that a printing press, paper and distribution/warehousing are involved. So I’m wondering what the USCCB does with money from ePub sales. Would it not be better to get the text into the hands of anyone who wants it—Catholic or not—for free, or for a much more reasonable cost? After all, people can find a thousand protestant Bibles, atheist texts, etc., all free on the Kindle store or in iBooks. And it’s easier for people to get the content from the major ebook stores as well.</p>

<p>Additionally, the USCCB claims the browser-based ebook is helpful for smartphone users. from the <a href="http://usccb.org/news/2012/12-107.cfm">press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"Our ability to use the new technologies means that many more millions will be able to find the Catholic Church’s teachings on their tablets, their smartphones, and their laptops."</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, this is only partially true: the online text is difficult, if not impossible, to read on any smartphone (I’ve tried on iPhone and Android). See:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/imagecache/300px-by-300px/user-uploads/Jeff%20Geerling/usccb-catechism-iphone.png" alt="Catechism on the iPhone" title="" class="imagecache-300px-by-300px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I don't think the USCCB is being dishonest. Rather, I think companies like <a href="http://www.figleaf.com/">Fig Leaf Software</a>&nbsp;take advantage of the fact that many nonprofits (especially Catholic nonprofits, in my experience) don't really know what's happening in the digital space, and end up selling solutions that are outmoded and even sometimes irrelevant.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In this case, <em>something</em> is better than <em>nothing</em>, and browsing on the iPad or a desktop is definitely not a bad experience. But it's not great either. The book is relatively fast to load, but the search is not topical (only keywords in the text), making the online Catechism not really useful as a research tool, only as a quick reference.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">My takeaway? It's good to see the USCCB trying to make more forays into the digital space... but please widen your research circle and look into solutions outside your current approved vendor list!</p>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/2012/vatican-applies-for-four-gtlds">Vatican Applies for Four gTLDs</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Today ICANN release a <a href="http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/application-results/strings-1200utc-13jun12-en">list of all the generic Top Level Domains</a> (gTLDs) that have been applied for since January 12 this year. Among rather oddball names such as .lol, .boo, and .barefoot, the Vatican (yes, the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/">Vatican.va</a> one in Italy) has applied for four domains, all variations of the English word ‘Catholic’. The domains are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>.catholic</li>
	<li>.католик</li>
	<li>.كاثوليك</li>
	<li>.天主教</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all of these domains will necessarily be approved, but I think there’s a good chance they will be, since the Vatican’s the only entity asking for them, and since they’re pretty much uncontested words.</p>

<p>The application came with a <a href="http://www.newgtldsite.com/new-gtld-Cost/">fee of $185,000/domain</a>—which is no small price—but the benefits of owning a top-level Domain are plenty, and I don’t find it unreasonable that the universal Church would spend a half-million to stake some territory on the Internet.</p>

<p>The Vatican has already said the domains would only be allowed for use by actual Catholic dioceses and organizations (you won’t be seeing curtjester.catholic or anything like that!), and, presumably, the Vatican already has resources in place to <a href="https://crm-gtld.icann.org/portal-icann/index.php?module=KBDocuments&amp;action=DetailView&amp;id=8f4aebf4-830f-9295-010a-4ecb0205aa62">run its own domain registry service</a> (probably not anything like GoDaddy, I’m sure!).</p>

<p>Of course, many see the opening up of top level domains (currently restricted to .com, .org, .net, among a bunch of others that are country or organization-specific) as a money grab by ICANN and some influential domain registrars. Another possible downside would be a ‘siloing’ of the Internet; I can imagine schools and certain organizations restricting all Internet access to a set of domains, like only .catholic and .edu… but we’ll see!</p>
