          <p>Pope Benedict XVI released his message for this year’s World Communications Day (which will be May 12th), with the theme <em>Social Networks: portals of truth and faith; new spaces for evangelization</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
...At times the gentle voice of reason can be overwhelmed by the din of excessive information and it fails to attract attention which is given instead to those who express themselves in a more persuasive manner. The social media thus need the commitment of all who are conscious of the value of dialogue, reasoned debate and logical argumentation; of people who strive to cultivate forms of discourse and expression which appeal to the noblest aspirations of those engaged in the communication process. Dialogue and debate can also flourish and grow when we converse with and take seriously people whose ideas are different from our own....

          <p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>My parish has finally decided to redo their website and are going with Drupal as the CMS. I wanted to be able to provide them with some examples of parishes who are using Drupal the right way. So I was wondering if anyone had examples of good parish website using Drupal. Also if anyone had some theme suggestions that would work well for a parish.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>As seen on <a href="http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com/2012/12/habemuspapam-pope-tweets.html">Whispers</a>…</p>

<p>A couple interesting notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Pope seems to have not actually triggered the tweet, as he pushed up on the screen, registering a scroll rather than a tweet. Oh well.</li>
<li>The Pope is using TweetDeck, but used Twitter for iPad for the first tweet.</li>
<li>The iPad nearly tumbled when the assistants confusedly picked it up and popped the smart cover off!</li>
<li>It didn't seem the entire event (the placement of the iPad, the actual tweeting, and the arrangement of people around the Pope) was that well rehearsed, but it did elicit some cheers from the crowd.</li>
</ul>

<p>The takeaway is that the Pope is on Twitter now. We’ll see how well the Vatican’s social media gurus handle the <a href="https://twitter.com/Pontifex">@pontifex</a> account. It could be a really good channel for connecting with many in society who spend more time communicating online than in the flesh!</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2012/strange-requests-for-translations-from-webhostinggeeks">Strange requests for translations from WebHostingGeeks</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>If you run a few different websites, you might have received a message at some point from a person by the name “Jovana Milutinovich” asking if she could translate a particular page on your website.</p>

<p>Typically, the page in question seems to have been randomly selected, and I posit that WebHostingGeeks is simply trying to get some inbound links for SEO, since I’ve researched other people receiving requests for translation, and noticed that many mailing lists (like ones for PHP, the W3C, and programming language user groups) have identical emails.</p>

<p>The email in question goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Jovana. I found your page about St. Louis' Eucharistic congress extremely interesting and would like to spread the word for people from Ex Yugoslavia.

Here's the URL of your page: [url]

Would you mind if I translate your page to Serbo-Croatian language and post it on our site?
My purpose is to help people from Ex Yugoslavia better understand some very useful information about computer science.

Some quick info about myself:
I was born in Yugoslavia, Europe. Former Yugoslavia consisted of now totally independent states like Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia, Bosnia &amp; Hercezovina, Slovenia and Macedonia, which are all united by Serbo-Croatian language.
I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Belgrade,Serbia.


With Kind Regards,

Jovana Milutinovich
science dot webhostinggeeks dot com
</blockquote>

<p>In my earlier naïvety, I said, “Why not?,” and am now receiving about an email a week from this very inquisitive person asking whether I’ve received her translation, and when I will link to it (yes, I did receive it, but no, I don’t think I’ll link to it). I’ve decided to not provide any links to the translated page, simply because it looks to be about the same quality as a Google Translate translation (as far as I can tell), and only seems to be a scammy SEO ploy.</p>

<p>This also should remind people to be very careful about what kind of SEO practices they use, and what companies/marketing groups they use to promote their websites. Don’t just go for some cheap inbound link generation scheme—develop meaningful links to your site.</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Apparently, on December 3, the Holy See Press Office will hold a press conference announcing the Pope’s official entry into the Twitterverse. From the <a href="http://www.news.va/en/news/the-pope-on-twitter">Vatican Information Service</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Vatican City, 29 November 2012 (VIS) – Benedict XVI will be present on Twitter. All related information will be reported on Monday 3 December at a press conference to be held in the Holy See Press Office, with the participation of Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli, president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, Msgr. Paul Tighe, secretary of the same dicastery, Fr. Federico Lombardi S.J., director of the Holy See Press Office, Professor Gian Maria Vian, editor of “L'Osservatore Romano”, and Greg Burke, Media Advisor to the Secretariat of State.

The Pope has already used the 140 character “tweet” format when, in June 2011, he launched the Vatican information portal www.news.va., with the words: “Dear friends, I just launched News.va. Praised be our Lord Jesus Christ! With my prayers and blessings, Benedictus XVI”.
</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-ipope-becomes-pope-coming-soon.html">Whispers in the Loggia</a>, Twitter’s director of social innovation, Claire Diaz Ortiz, will be present at the press conference. I find this interesting, because while many would say the Church is ‘out of touch’ with the modern world/social media/etc., I think Ortiz’ presence at the press conference can also be construed as a sign that the sphere of social media has a thing or two to learn from the Catholic Church—especially from Pope Benedict.</p>

<p>He will be assisting in ‘making holy’ the Twittersphere, hopefully, but don’t expect an @reply from the Pope himself! I’m hoping his account will be a model for other high-ranking Catholic figures—who should be less like <a href="https://twitter.com/SHAQ">@SHAQ</a> or other celebrities (who seem to use social media to have fun, make fun, and promote themselves, thus making them less interesting figures), and should be more reserved.</p>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>ActivPrayer is a faith-based organization that is building an open-source faith-sharing platform centered around purpose-driven action. For example, a high school athlete can dedicate his next football game for Pro-Life causes around the world or to his mother and then share his “ActivPrayer” with the world when it’s completed via rich media. This is done both through the ActivPrayer iphone app and our website, which will have a live streaming feed of ActivPrayers from around the world at live.activprayer.org.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate this project, we will need a technology manager (effectively, a CTO) who can manage all aspects of the development process and do much of the necessary work personally if needed or if we fail to recruit an adequate team of open-source developers.</p>

<p>ActivPrayer was founded by a Catholic seminarian and is currently a large, ecumenical movement supported by large organizations such as Reebok.</p>

<p>We are willing to pay up to $5,000/month on a monthly contract or up to $60,000/year on a long-term contract, with generous benefits (including stock options/company ownership).</p>

<p>You love building websites using emerging technologies.
You believe the work day should be dynamic, ever-evolving, and filled with prayer.
You’re comfortable working within the design team.
Your eye for detail ensures that our projects stay pretty, clean, and well maintained.
You like seeing features come to fruition and are able to jump into a project at any point in its lifecycle
You’re hip to the latest requirements for cross-browser compatibility and page optimization</p>

<p>You know your stuff:</p>

<p>Extremely familiar with HTML and HTML5, including the use of new HTML5 elements, attributes and features.
Confident with CSS3, ability to leverage new features while supporting older browsers with graceful degradation, you’re keen on responsive design, and efficient CSS markup.
You must have experience with CMS (WordPress, etc.)
Experience with mobile web development and performance.
Cross-browser and cross-platform development
Very strong with Javascript; you don’t just know jQuery, you know legit Javascript. You love the module pattern (among others), and properly organizing code for large web applications.
Intuitive and excellent visual eye
Robust portfolio with working samples
You’ve worked with some form of version management system (SVN, GIT, Mercurial, etc)</p>

<p>Please respond directly to Luke Burgis, CEO, at luke@activprayer.org if interested. Please include CV and/or portfolio, as well any other information you feel might be relevant to the hiring process.</p>
