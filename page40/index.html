<p>I'm redesigning a website for some friends of mine (who also happen to be  Catholic).&nbsp; <strong>Okay, so here is my dilemma:</strong> I'm creating a custom template in  <em>Wordpress</em> (and let all the <em>Drupal</em> fans moan in unison ; )&nbsp; and I've created some  pretty cool rollover buttons that look and work great on the homepage, however,  when I click on an individual page or post, the menu bar collapses and then  disappears.&nbsp; I think I know what is causing this, but may need some  assistance!</p>
<p>The problem is that the Preload script and the Styles script is in the  &lt;head&gt; of the &quot;header.php&quot; file.&nbsp; Then the Onload script and the Slices  scripts are in the &lt;body&gt;.&nbsp; I think the problem is where I have my &lt;div  id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt; and &lt;div id=&quot;header&quot;&gt; placed.&nbsp; I have it placed in the  body, after the Onload script and before the slices scripts.&nbsp; Can you put the  &lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt; and &lt;div id=&quot;header&quot;&gt; in the &lt;head&gt;???</p>
<p>Please don't get mad at me, if I should know this.&nbsp; I'm kind of learning this  stuff on my own.&nbsp; When I was in college (10 years ago) web design was basically  HTML&nbsp;and Java.</p>
<p>Here is a before and after shot of what the site currently looks like (done  by someone else) and what it may look like if I figure this out.&nbsp; I'm trying to  keep a simple and clean look to the site.&nbsp; When I think of dental lab, I don't  want to see a black background, the generic navigational bar, and the old 90's  visitor's counter!&nbsp; It needs to look professional.</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>The USCCB has launched yet another one-off website, this time for <a href="http://www.usccb.org/advent/">Advent and Christmas, 2009</a>. I commend their willingness to continually push tons of new data out to the Catholics in the US through these one-off websites (<a href="http://www.usccb.org/healthcare/">Health Care Reform</a>, <a href="http://www.usccb.org/romanmissal/">New Roman Missal Translation</a>, et all), but I wonder if they are starting to consider more long-term solutions to the problem of creating mass quantities of different HTML-only websites that don't really seem to fit together or use any kind of CMS.</p>
<p>Some oddities in source code aside, what happens if the USCCB wants to change its logo across all these websites. Right now, it seems the title bar is the same across all the sites, which is good, but they'd still have to update a plethora (thousands upon thousands, in fact) of html / shtml pages with the updated code for a new menu, and many instances of the logo.gif file.</p>
<p>Everything I'm trying to do in my work, I do it with an eye not towards the end of this year, or even five years down the road. Rather, I'm hoping that the seeds I plant today, with regard to data structures and data presentation (which should always be separated!), will germinate and be able to continue to grow, expand, and flourish for at least the next 20, 50, 100 years.</p>
<p>So many data-intensive projects reside in individual HTML files in Church work - we need to move towards using open, accessible data formats, databases, and markup in our work, so that we can preserve and continually improve our Catholic data online in the years to come.</p>
<p>HTML files are fine, in my opinion, if they are the front end to a good database backend (for instance, if you're caching pages from a CMS, or if you're generating a version of the file from a database, which can be updated from the database later). Let data be data, and presentation show that data in various ways. This is the only road we can follow if we want to continue to grow on the Internet, and on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic web</a>.</p>

          <p>This is a complicated story but one that must be told. I'm not sure there is anything that can be done about it except rage at the moon...<br />
<br />
But it needs to be told none the less.<br />
<br />
Did I mention it gets complicated?  It does, but it does so for a reason.   Let's introduce the starting lineup.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Players:<br />
<br />
*Our Principal - In the US.<br />
<br />
*An Indian Contracting Company<br />
<br />
*A large computer/server company with three letters in their name.<br />
<br />
*A large credit card company with four letters in their name.<br />
<br />
*A friend of The Principal<br />
<br />
The Principal is a guy who works with Linux Servers for a living. He was contacted by the Indian Contracting Company and asked to apply for a project position through the large company with three letters in their name. The contract was to patch the 1000+ linux servers with some proprietary SAN access software<br />
<br />
With me so far?</p>

          <p>I finally had a few hours tonight to update the modules and Drupal core on Open Source Catholic, and I hope to have some time to perform some bugfixes on the Airy Blue theme as well.</p>
<p>As part of the upgrade process, I finally took care of many todo items in my procrastination list&mdash;I moved all the remaining articles to blogs and set up 301 redirects. I also rearranged the links across the top of the site, removed the 'Contact' form (it had been used once, ever), and added/styled a few blocks on the right for forum topics and comments.</p>
<p>Have any more suggestions to make the site better optimized for your use?</p>
<p>[Edit: I've also merged this site into a Drupal multisite install running <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/">Life is a Prayer.com</a>, <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/">Midwestern Mac, LLC</a>, and <a href="http://www.spiritandtruthstl.org/">Spirit and Truth St. Louis</a>, and re-enabled the Boost caching module to speed things up.

          <a class="post-link" href="/2009/want-link-juice-get-your-feed-on-catholic-news-live">Want Link Juice? Get your Feed on Catholic News Live.</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p><img alt="Link Juice Drink" width="300" height="228" style="margin: 10px;" align="right" src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/link-juice.jpg" />Apparently, the Google Bot is quite happy when your a website offers a constantly updating home page - to the tune of 1,000+ page hits per day! Catholic News Live has received an average of 13,000 page views per week from the Google Bot since it's launch two weeks ago... meaning it has had a field day updating content from the site, and finding stories from Catholic blogs and news sites. It seems the bot checks in at least once an hour.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you, lowly webmaster? Well, if you can get your feed on Catholic News Live, you can get the Google Bot to index an inbound link (which does NOT have any kind of rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; attribute, so you get some link juice from Google) pretty much every time you post a story. That can be pretty valuable if you want your posts to show up on Google quickly!</p>
<p>(An aside &ndash; <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_juice">Link Juice</a></strong>, in case you were wondering, is what we refer to when talking about the whole idea of Google pagerank and inbound link 'votes' - Google uses inbound links from legitimate and established websites to determine whether <em>your</em> site (the site linked <em>to</em>) appears higher in its rankings for certain search terms. More on SEO to come - for now, do some Google searches on the topic...).</p>
<p>Two questions come to mind from this discovery:</p>
<!--break-->
<p>1. How did Catholic News Live get indexed and revisited so much by the Google Bot so quickly?</p>
<p class="rteindent1">The day I decided to push CNL out onto the Internet and publicly announce it, I put links up from Open Source Catholic, LifeisaPrayer.com, and LOLSaints, as well as from as many Twitter feeds as I could utilize (I help maintain at least five).</p>
<p class="rteindent1">I also posted stories on <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs/geerlingguy/managing-news-revolutionary&mdash;not-evolutionary&mdash;step-drupal">MidwesternMac.com</a>, <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/oscatholic/announcing-catholic-news">Open Source Catholic</a>, and <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/blog/2009/announcing-catholic-news-live">Lifeisaprayer.com</a> concerning the launch of the site, and left the site URL in a few comments concerning the Managing News system, as well as in bug reports on the Drupal website.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">All these sites are indexed rather frequently by Google, so CNL was almost immediately put into the Google index. After that, you simply need to wait a little while until the Google Bot starts indexing your site regularly - the bot decides how often to visit your site based on how frequently the site is updated, and whether your site is responsive (good ping times and response times are essential!).</p>
<p>2. What kind of awesome sauce can CNL and sites like it spread?</p>
<p class="rteindent1">Sites which aggregate other sites' news and postings should always link straight back to the source, and should never act as if the content is their own. To this extent, Catholic News Live only aggregates about 300 words of any given posting, and links straight out to whatever website the blog post is from, meaning users (and Google) is directed to the source.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">Because the title of each posting links directly to the source website, Catholic News Live helps smaller Catholic blogs, news publications, and other sites to get their content indexed by the Google Bot more quickly, since the Google Bot sifts through CNL so often (more often than most other sites on which <em>I've</em> ever worked).</p>
<p class="rteindent1">To get your site on CNL, visit the <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/node/1">About section</a> and read through the directions. We'd love to have you!</p>
