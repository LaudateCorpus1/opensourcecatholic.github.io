          <p>As more Catholic websites are adding comment forms and feedback forms, the problem of form spam (where you get submissions that are either obviously not written by humans, or submissions that are simply opportunities for people to link back to their own websites) increases.</p>

<p>I wrote a post on <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/articles/web-design/2011/preventing-form-spam">user-friendly spam prevention techniques</a> that I employ on my websites over on Life is a Prayer.com, and in that post, I talk about the importance of making your spam prevention user-friendly. I specifically write about how detrimental CAPTCHAs are to usability and user happiness.</p>

<p>After you <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/articles/web-design/2011/preventing-form-spam">read the article</a>, do you have any other ideas or techniques that you use to stop spam and make your users and commenters happy?</p>

<p align="center">November 2nd 2011</p>
<p>Few moments in OneBillionStories.com’s (OBS) short history measure up to this one right here – let the global search begin for assembling a team for the mission.</p>

<p> For twenty months, the mission of OBS was led by a lone ranger (me, Seth DeMoor), traveling the ‘digital continent’ frontier, with no more than a video camera and laptop as his companions, and look where the mission has traveled: to every continent (digitally), to multiple TV appearances, to a new language, and all in 20 short months.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;Where will OBS go next?</p>
<p align="center">The Big Man up above only knows this answer, but as the Vicar of Jesus Christ on earth reminds Catholics around the world:</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>“</em><em>It falls, in particular, to <strong>young</strong> people, who have an almost spontaneous affinity for the new means of communication, to take on the responsibility for the evangelization of this ‘digital continent’.”</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&nbsp;</em>Who will answer <strong>Pope Benedict XVI’s</strong> call of service to the Church through the authentic witness of Catholicism on this new digital frontier? Perhaps he is calling you? If so, we want to hear about your ache to leave your cubicle and join a 21<sup>st</sup> century Catholic revolution.</p>
<p> The work will be difficult, incredibly rewarding, uncertain at many turns, and probably the best ‘job’ of your life. There will be no pay (initially), no insurance, only an opportunity to wake up daily with a mission, to share ‘one billion Catholic stories’ and beyond doing what you love to do! Who’s in?</p>
<p align="center">OBS is looking for:</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;People ready to move to Denver, Colorado to form a team and begin working on the mission in the fields of:&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">••• Videographer/editor ••• Web designer ••• Programmer ••• Accountant/Advertising manager ••• Producer</p>
<p>If you’re still reading, that’s a good start, e-mail <a href="mailto:seth@onebillionstories.com">seth@onebillionstories.com</a> to receive a personal invitation and password for next week’s LIVE video chat on the website, to further explore the mission and vision. Till next time. Seth J. DeMoor</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2011/private-social-networks-for-parishes">Private Social Networks for Parishes</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I read a good post on the idea of parish online communities yesterday, over on Catholic Tech Talk (great site!), titled: <a href="http://catholictechtalk.com/blog/2011/10/06/private-vs-public/">Parish Online Communities: Private vs. Public</a>. In it, Ryan Foley speaks about the value of parishes having private communities incorporated with their websites and parish member management systems.</p>
<p>I wrote, in response:</p>
<p>Coming from the perspective of having worked on a similar kind of project diocesan-wide (for priests), I have to say that creating an insular (parish-level, or even diocese-level) social networks is a serious undertaking.</p>
<p>We've tried twice to create online spaces (private social networks) for a particular population of the diocese, but both times, after an initial push by a few people that were forced into being leaders, the experiment failed. The reasons were many, but mostly boiled down to:</p>
<ol><li>Not enough buy-in to make it worthwhile (the people who were most active were those who were already using other communications channels to keep in touch anyways).</li><li>Not enough 'space' (a few people posted a lot, causing many of the priests who would've otherwise been interested to stay out of the discussion).</li><li>The 'just another network' syndrome; for many of the people who seemed they would be the target demographic, they quickly responded with complaints that we were simply asking them to manage yet another profile/persona, and one which didn't really provide them added value (compared to the small communities they were already in on Facebook, Twitter, and in real life).</li></ol>
<!--break-->
<p>I'm not saying this to downplay the idea of a social network—rather, I'd say it's important to be prepared. If you want to make a successful private network (as have many large corporations, and some smaller communities), you need to have a lot in place from the start:</p>
<ul><li>A 'community manager' (or many), who will moderate things, try to keep discussions sane, and ensure the network is always fresh.</li><li>A 'hook' (or many); something that will keep people coming back. Once the online community is established, the hook might *be* the community. This must be something people will value and want more of. With Facebook, it's connections with past and present friends and family (and pictures). With Twitter, it's often meaningful, quick conversations, or simple sharing.</li><li>Simplicity in setup and management: If people can login quickly, and get started immediately, you'll have a much better chance of at least letting people in the door. If you make people do a lot of things before they can even see what you have to offer, you're shutting the door already.</li></ul>
<p>Do I think a private social network is good for a parish? It depends on the parish... I think many, if not most, are not ready for one. Do I think flockNote is good for a parish? Same answer. Sadly, most of our work right now needs to be in the field of getting pastors and leaders simply to consider the possible positive impact online community and relationships (in any form) will make on people's lives. Only with their full support can an initiative like using a social network or finding new communications channels have any fruits.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for flockNote.</em></p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2011/mobile-app-development-resources">Mobile App Development Resources</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Is your parish or organization interested in building its own iPhone, Android, or Blackberry App? There are tons of resources available to help you in building the App.</p>

<p>There are different ways you can get your own app:</p>

<h3>Build Your Own (DIY)</h3>

<p>This is often difficult due to lack of resources (time, money, programming personnel), but is highly advantageous in that a custom-made App can do pretty much anything you want.</p>

<p>This approach requires knowledge of different development frameworks and programming languages (Objective-C and Xcode for iOS, Java for Android, etc., or a framework like Appcelerator), and it can take a bit of effort to get a bug-free application that works well on a mobile device.</p>

<p>Open Source Catholic also contains resources for a <a href="/project/catholic-diocese-app">Catholic Diocese App</a> that can be customized to fit a diocese or archdiocese’s needs.</p>

<h3>Hire a Development Company / Developer</h3>

<p>If you want a very flexible App, that can do specialized things, and is perfect for your organization, you can often hire out a developer or development company to help you build and App.</p>

<p>Below is a list of Catholic app developers and companies who are known to work well with Catholic organizations:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.littleiapps.com/">Little i Apps</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://surgeworks.com/">Surgeworks</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.petrosmedia.com/">Petros Media</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.stclementepress.org/">St Clement ePress</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.travisboudreaux.com/">Travis Boudreaux</a> (individual)</li>
	<li><a href="http://cliffsidecatholic.com/">Michael Bianco</a> (individual)</li>
	<li><a href="http://valent.co/">Valent Richie</a> (individual)</li>
	<li><a href="http://earblast.com/">Earblast</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Buying a Cookie-Cutter/Prepackaged App</h3>

<p>If you have limited resources and no specialized needs, it may be advantageous to use a pre-made solution, where you simply connect your website to a pre-made App solution. Here are some of the companies that offer this kind of service, usually with very reasonable pricing:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.thechurchapp.org/">The Church App</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.r04r.com/">ROAR</a></li>
