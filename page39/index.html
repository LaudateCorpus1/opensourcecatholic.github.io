	Simply amazing! Google has been very impressive of late, introducing Wave, Google Voice, and Google Docs improvements. Now they have real-time search, which pushes updates as they happen around the web (from Twitter, Facebook, and other sites) into your search results.</p>
<p>

Then post a Tweet while you&#39;re watching, and prepare to be amazed!</p>

          <p>
	Today OSC has been updated to use CKEditor rather than FCKEditor in all the text input areas. CKEditor (at least, in my testing) loads much faster due to rewritten javascript, and looks a little cleaner (dare I say, more OSC-like?) than the aging FCKEditor.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ve considered using the WYSIWYG API along with TinyMCE, but the dedicated CKEditor module seems to be pretty great.</p>
<p>
	Let me know if you encounter any big problems!</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <blockquote>[He] sends his own personal emails. He does!</blockquote>
<p>So says Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli, president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, confirming that Pope Benedict XVI is technologically savvy. (As seen in Our Sunday Visitor).</p>
<p>Just like the art of letter-writing, people can tell when you are being personal, when you are actually giving your own time and your own words to a response. How many times have you emailed or written a politician, or a famous person, and received either a form-generated response, or something that sounds canned?</p>
<p>Your organization can always benefit from giving personal responses. I write every single response to every single email I receive; for a short time, I had a series of canned copy/paste responses for certain questions, but I gave up on that once I realized that taking an extra five minutes out of every day would help me to be able to connect more personally with those who went out of their way to contact me.</p>
<p>If you are the leader of an organization, or a person held in high regard, you have the power to greatly influence people and help them feel closer to your organization (or Church) through your personal touch. Take the time to write a response&mdash;whether that be through email, a hand-written or typed letter, or even through a secretary. People on the other end will tell you took the time for them, and will remember that.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2009/firefox-starts-taking-larger-marketshare">FireFox Starts Taking Larger Marketshare</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p class="rteleft">Despite Microsoft including Internet Explorer in all its operating systems, people are installing FireFox as their default browser at an astonishing rate. I take pride in the fact that all but two of the sites I help maintain have already seen FireFox (and sometimes even Safari) overtake Explorer (all versions combined) as the most used browser.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="FireFox overtakes IE Marketshare - Analytics" width="600" height="273" src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/osc-firefox-share.jpg" /></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><em>FireFox far surpasses IE on any even remotely tech-oriented website.</em></p>
<p class="rteleft">The sites that still get more Explorer traffic are parish and Archdiocesan websites (which are typically visited by an older demographic, and/or people who are using office computers).</p>
<p class="rteleft">Germany, apparently, is the first country in which <a href="http://thenextweb.com/europe/2009/12/02/congratulations-mozilla-firefox-overtakes-internet-explorer-germany/">Explorer's long-standing crown as the most-used browser has been taken away</a> by FireFox.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Of course, having 99% of the web use FireFox would be just as bad as 99% using Internet Explorer. I'm hoping Safari, Chrome, FireFox, and Internet Explorer all stay around awhile and help spark more innovation and speed in the browser arena.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Are you still using Internet Explorer? Why? The only thing I've used it for in the past two years is to test sites and make sure they work for the underprivileged part of the population who is forced (willingly or no) into using the sadness that is IE 6, 7 or even 8. Hopefully 9 will be an improvement... but it might be too little too late.</p>

<p class="rteleft">I'd suggest looking at these with Firebug to see what the code looks like, because there are a lot of elements at play with this issue.</p>
<p class="rteleft">The problem: In Safari or Firefox, if you check out the beta <a href="http://www.drew-walker.com/sanjose">here</a>, mouseover the &quot;Join&quot; tab and take a look at how the first column of choices is not recognized as hyperlinked, but the second column is.
