          <a class="post-link" href="/2010/news-websites-make-your-news-readable">News Websites: Make Your News Readable!</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>For anyone involved in web development for news publications, one of the most important aspects of the website is its textual layout.&nbsp;Your site must be readable on a variety of devices, and, failing that, you should try to make it look great on at least one platform (usually the desktop browser)&mdash;typically other platforms will follow.</p>
<p>There are a few things to watch out for:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can have lines too close together&mdash;use line-height to give proper spacing/breathing room between consecutive lines of text.</li>
<li>You can have paragraphs too close together&mdash;add some margins between paragraphs so they are divided visually.</li>
<li>You can have too narrow a viewport for your content, meaning users spend more time scrolling than reading. (However, you don&#39;t want to have it too wide either&mdash;sometimes a semi-fluid layout can be useful).</li>
</ol>
<!--break-->
<p>Let&#39;s take an example:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Catholic News Service narrow viewport" class="imagecache-300px-by-300px" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/imagecache/300px-by-300px/user-uploads/oscatholic/cns-website-narrow.png" title="" /></p>
<p>The Catholic News Service website has been around for a very long time, and they distribute tons of articles to the Catholic community. Their website, as it currently stands, is a bit difficult to read for those with larger screen sizes.</p>
<p>Opening up the site with Safari, I can enable Reader use Instapaper to read the story in a wider format, but that is a barrier to getting to read the content quickly.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Catholic News Service in Safari Reader" class="imagecache-300px-by-300px" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/imagecache/300px-by-300px/user-uploads/oscatholic/cns-website-safari-reader.png" title="" /></p>
<p>In order to make their layout more presentable, I would suggest the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the body text black (right now it&#39;s blue), for added contrast.</li>
<li>Make the layout about 200px (or more) wider, for longer lines of text.</li>
<li>Possibly diversify the color scheme a bit&mdash;an orange color would be great for highlighting certain elements; alternatively, some more greys could help hide certain distracting elements (like meta information).</li>
</ul>
<p>I think most Catholic news organizations could take a second look at their website and begin the groundwork towards making their sites easier to read for any visitors&mdash;especially those reading the site on the desktop. I realize that some of these sites have a lot of legacy content that would need to be updated to make it conform to a new design, but nowadays tools are more abundant than ever to get this to happen, and I&#39;m sure there are some on this site who would be willing to help :-)</p>
<p>(As an aside: RSS feeds are also helpful for readability, as many people are used to reading news through their favorite news readers&mdash;if your site doesn&#39;t have an RSS feed (or many), then you should consider adding one at some point. It has other benefits as well, such as increased exposure to the Google News site and other aggregators).</p>

          <p>Something I posted on the Archdiocese of St. Louis&#39; <a href="http://archstldev.com/">Development Website</a> earlier today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As technology has progressed in the past hundred years, the amount of information that is immediately accessible has increased at an exponential rate. As time goes on, people are more and more used to the idea of immediate gratification when it comes to images, text, and stories from events.</p>
<p>There is a new term phrased to wrap up this near-instantaneous stream of live information produced around the world: the &#39;real-time web.&#39;</p>
<p>But what exactly is the real-time web? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_web">Wikipedia</a> can help us here:</p>
<p><em>&quot;The real-time web is a set of technologies and practices which enable users to receive information as soon as it is published by its authors, rather than requiring that they or their software check a source periodically for updates.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Basically, there are many new technologies available today that weren&#39;t even heard of just ten or fifteen years ago, including &quot;RSS&quot;, &quot;XML&quot; and other ways of exchanging information.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What does this mean for you? Well, for your organization to stay at the fore online, and to reach the broadest range of people, you need to be able to participate in this real-time web.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2010/connecting-to-the-facebook-api">Connecting to the Facebook API</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Facebook has a lot of data available to website developers through their Open Graph API, and Facebook also offers a ton of nice features to web developers to tie into Facebook&#39;s user profiles, commenting system, &#39;Like&#39; system, etc.</p>
<p>While it may be argued how tightly your site should integrate with Facebook for a user&#39;s interaction with your site (do you really want something as essential as login to depend on an external service?), it is not a hard decision to allow some degree of Facebook integration with your site&mdash;after all, many of your site&#39;s users are likely Facebook users already, and they will be more likely to already be familiar with Facebook functionality and terminology.</p>
<p>To get started integrating Facebook features into your site, you can read through <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/">Facebook&#39;s Developer documentation</a>, and after you have set up your own Facebook account, you can add the &#39;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/developers/">Facebook Developer App</a>&#39; to your profile, then click the &#39;Set Up New Application&#39; button to add an App to facebook that integrates with your website (for the App&#39;s title, enter the name of your site, or whatever you&#39;d like).</p>
<p>If you&#39;re using PHP for your website (who isn&#39;t?), you can download <a href="http://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/downloads">Facebook&#39;s PHP SDK</a>, and get started building Facebook integration into your website.</p>
<p>An example of Facebook integration offered on Open Source Catholic is the fan page follower counts for the Archdiocese of Saint Louis. Following kovshenin.com&#39;s guide &quot;<a href="http://kovshenin.com/archives/how-to-count-facebook-fans-in-php/">How to Count Facebook Fans</a>,&quot; we came up with the following PHP code to get a follower count for a particular page:</p>
<p>&lt;?php
// This is where you put the facebook.php file downloaded from the Facebook PHP SDK site
require_once(‘sites/all/libraries/facebook-php/src/facebook.php’);</p>

<p>$facebook = new Facebook(array(
  ‘appId’  =&gt; ‘YOUR_APPID_PASTED_HERE’,
  ‘secret’ =&gt; ‘YOUR_SECRET_PASTED_HERE’,
  ‘cookie’ =&gt; true,
));</p>

<p>$result = $facebook-&gt;api(array(
	‘method’ =&gt; ‘fql.query’,
	‘query’ =&gt; ‘select fan_count from page where page_id = YOUR_PAGE_ID_PASTED_HERE;’
));</p>

<p>$fb_fans = $result[0][‘fan_count’];</p>

<p>print ‘&lt;p&gt;The Archdiocese of St. Louis has $fb_fans Fans.&lt;/p&gt;’;
?&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Facebook Features&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p>One of the easiest parts of Facebook you can integrate is the &#39;Like&#39; button - Facebook lets its users &#39;Like&#39; any page, comment, status update, etc. across the web, and you can embed a small snippet of code in your blog or website to allow users to &#39;Like&#39; a page.</p>
<p>For instance, here&#39;s a like button embedded on this page:</p>
<iframe src="http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opensourcecatholic.com%2Fwiki%2F117%2Fconnecting-facebook-api&amp;layout=standard&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=450&amp;action=like&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=35" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:35px;" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<p>More information about the Like button, and other simple Facebook feature integrations, can be found on Facebook&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web#plugins">Facebook for Websites</a>&quot; page.</p>

          <p>Jeff&#39;s post here on OSCatholic titled &quot;<a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/oscatholic/what-makes-good-parish-website">What Makes a Good Parish Website?</a>&quot; brought me to brainstorm and design a PowerPoint presentation for clergy and parish staff/volunteers in the Diocese of Sacramento, to get folks moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, June 1, 2010, I delivered this presentation to ~100 attendees at our first annual diocesan <em>Stewardship Conference</em>.</p>
<p>I recorded the audio on my <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?cid=4286770754533665546">Olympus WS-300M</a> and edited it with <a href="http://www.makepropaganda.com/products.html">Propaganda</a>.&nbsp; Then, I broke the audio into 21 separate files to match the 21 slides of the PowerPoint presentation using <a href="http://www.roxio.com/enu/products/creator/suite/overview.html?AID=10440198">Roxio Creator 2010</a> (this step was a necessary evil, as I discovered).&nbsp; Finally, I downloaded and installed a trial copy of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fproducts%2Fpresenter%2F&amp;ei=qn4JTOb6OYvQM7agmLYE&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBk2_TjDqPupSg_X42LitG7VlMSA">Adobe Presenter 7</a> to sync each audio file to each slide&#39;s animation and to produce an online copy of the presentation in Flash.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping that this digital copy of the presentation will make its way into the offices of many diocesan and parish clergy and staff, to assist our Catholic parishes in publishing <em>great</em> parish websites.</p>

          <p>It looks like <a href="http://twitter.com/ijimcoyle">@iJimCoyle</a> is tweeting from the Catholic Media Conference in Louisiana this week. Found today on his Twitter stream:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Media &amp; New Evangelization: 5 Ways to Make a Difference</strong> (from Sr Rose Pacatte FSP)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Become mindful media consumers by watching (doing) media together and talking about what you experience.</li>
<li>Use (mainstream) media in your teaching.</li>
<li>Become a media producer &amp; encourage students &amp; people w/ whom you share faith to &quot;make media.&quot;</li>
<li>Make media the subject of evangelization, preaching, and catechesis.</li>
<li>Become proactive advocate for media productions that reflect Catholic social teaching because these are human, humane, &amp; Gospel themes.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds great... but where is the significance for &#39;new media?&#39; At a time when our news media is bleeding like never before, hurting for money and looking to find a solid path for working online in the midst of the traditional web, Twitter, FourSquare, Facebook, etc., we need to be more specific in our goals for new media use in the Church, especially by Catholic publications.</p>
<p>Of course, reading from a live Twitter feed of a participant might not be the best way to participate in this Catholic Media Convention, but there isn&#39;t any other way to do it, and the <a href="http://www.catholicpress.org/?page=ConventionBlog">Convention Blog doesn&#39;t even seem to have any content</a>... It would be nice to have at least an official Twitter feed :)</p>
<p>At least they have a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Catholic-Media-Convention/372226473180">Facebook page</a>...</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I was scratching my head after trying to troubleshoot a template problem for a few hours today; I was building a Zen subtheme for a site that had, until now, been using Garland for it&#39;s styling. In this subtheme, I wanted to have comments display with a similar look to Garland, and I especially wanted automatic permalinks to comments, referenced by a comment number:</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Comment template - zen removes linked comment number titles." height="302" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/zen-comment-template.png" title="" width="600" /></p>
<p>I looked through comment.tpl.php, and my template.php file, as well as zen&#39;s template.php file, but couldn&#39;t find anything related to the $id variable, which is used to build the numbered permalink. After opening up Devel themer, I found that there was a call to _zen_preprocess_comment(), and that was the likely culprit...</p>
<p>To restore these comment numbers/permalinks, you will need to grab core&#39;s <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/template_preprocess_comment/6">TEMPLATE_preprocess_comment</a> function and place it in your subtheme&#39;s template.php file. (This is an easy fix... if you&#39;d like to get more advanced, you can hack the code to do other more Zen-like things, like print &#39;first&#39; and &#39;last&#39; classes for comments).</p>
<p>Be sure to change TEMPLATE to the name of your theme!</p>
<p>After you do that, your theme should have comment styling very similar to that of other core themes, with the permalink comment number intact (see below for the final product).</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Pretty Zen comment titles - numbered permalinks!" height="316" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/pretty-zen-comment-titles.png" title="" width="600" /><br />
