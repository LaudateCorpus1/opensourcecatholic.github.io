        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I have, for some time, used the amazingly dexterous Rules module on my Drupal sites to receive email notifications when new comments were posted. I set up a Rule in the admin interface which would send an email if a new comment was saved on the site.</p>
<p>In the &#39;Message&#39; section of the Rule&#39;s &#39;send email to arbitrary address&#39; action, I would include a link to the commented-upon node, as well as the body of the comment text.</p>
<p>However, I wanted to also have a couple convenient links included: one link to allow me to quickly delete the comment (if the comment was spammy), and a link to edit the comment (sometimes I need to see the email address of the author, or change some wording if it&#39;s mildly inappropriate).</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rules">Rules</a> is well-acquainted with the similarly amazing <a href="http://drupal.org/project/token">Token</a> module, so all I had to do was enter the following in the &#39;Message&#39; (replacing what I had):</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>From an <a href="http://www.todaysparish.com/Parish-social-media">article posted to Today&#39;s Parish</a>, from <a href="http://twitter.com/jongivens">@jongivens</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, it would have been considered &ldquo;cutting edge&rdquo; for a parish to be using social media, but now everyone is doing it. So the question isn&rsquo;t should parishes be using social media, but how can they use it with intentionality to support their ministry goals. Before a minister or parish committee member even sets up a Twitter account, Facebook page, or blog for the parish, they need to discern what it is they are trying to accomplish with these new media tools.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;The Priest and Pastoral Ministry in a Digital World: New Media at the Service of the Word,&rdquo; Pope Benedict XVI outlined the importance of social media and the need for priests and lay people to adapt to this cultural shift. Using excerpts from the pope&rsquo;s letter as a framework, this article lays out three basic steps for creating a social media strategy for a parish or ministry organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define your goals</li>
<li>Meet your audience</li>
<li>Build your content</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing we haven&#39;t heard before, but a good consideration for every parish and Catholic organization: <strong>what is your strategy for online communications</strong> (even more broad than simply social media use... you should also consider traditional email marketing, and website content management)?</p>
<p>Of course, I must contest the point that &#39;everybody&#39;s doing it&#39; when it comes to parishes and social media... <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/oscatholic/study-shows-23-churches">fully 66% of churches don&#39;t use social media</a>&mdash;and that&#39;s all Christians. Catholic churches, I&#39;m sure, would see a smaller minority using social media.</p>
<p>I think the battle still needs to be fought over whether or not a parish should be using social media... not how they should use it (just yet ;-). Many priests and parish councils simply see no need for it at this point.</p>

          <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I just moved a website to a completely new hosting provider AND CMS (Joomla to WordPress).</p>
<p>The problem is that I&#39;m getting a number of http requests that are obviously for the OLD site - variations like this - http://www.website.com/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3483&amp;Itemid=384</p>
<p>Is there any way to &#39;redirect&#39; these http requests to my new homepage (index.php). It would have to be a wildcard since there were over 3,000 articles on the old site.</p>
<p>To recap...is it possible to redirect http requests as follows</p>
<p>http://www.website.com/?option=com_content* to http://www.website.com</p>
<p>I&#39;m assuming this would need to be done via the .htaccess file.</p>
<p>Thanks for suggestions!</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2010/website-hosting-management-dns-information">Website Hosting Management, DNS Information</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Almost every website on the Internet is accessed using a name like &quot;www.opensourcecatholic.com&quot; or &quot;www.archstl.org.&quot; These are called <em>domain names</em>. There is a whole system on the internet called DNS, which allow people&#39;s computers to access the right information when they type in a domain name in their browser.</p>
<p>In order to have a website that is accessible via a domain name, you need to have a domain name registrar to set up the domain name... kind of like how you need a telephone company to give you a phone number.</p>
<p>There are many domain name registrars on the Internet (too many to go through in a comprehensive manner), but we typically recommend <a href="http://www.name.com/">name.com</a> or <a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/domains">Yahoo! Small Business</a>. Once you have purchased a domain name (for example, mycatholicparish.com or awesomeparish.org), you will need to use a web hosting company to &#39;serve&#39; your website.</p>
<p>There are many different options when it comes to a web hosting company:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can manage your own website without having to know much about web development or pay a lot of money (or any at all!) by using a solution such as <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> or <a href="http://www.drupalgardens.com/">Drupal Gardens</a>.</li>
<li>You can put your own web pages or website system on a server for a relatively low cost per month using a host like <a href="http://www.hostgator.com/">Host Gator</a> or <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a>.</li>
<li>(If you have a lot of website visitors, or have special requirements for your website) You can put your website on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or dedicated server. This is only recommended for organizations with more resources to devote to their websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever option you choose, you should be sure that the information for logging in and managing your accounts with both the registrar and the hosting company resides not with any individual, but with the organization.</p>
<h3>Keeping Things Running</h3>
<p>Many times, a web developer is called and asked if he or she can help an organization move the organization&#39;s website to a different hosting company. This is not always an easy task... and it&#39;s especially hard if the organization has no idea (a) who owns/manages their domain name, or (b) the login information for their web hosting company.</p>
<p>You can find out the information for your domain name, at least, using the <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/">&#39;whois&#39; tool at DomainTools.com</a>. Go to that website, and enter your domain name. For example, here&#39;s the <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/opensourcecatholic.com">whois information for opensourcecatholic.com</a>.</p>
<p>The person listed as the administrative contact should typically be the person who owns/manages the domain name for your organization. If you contact this person, he or she should be able to help you get control of your domain name.</p>
<h3>Losing Your Domain Name</h3>
<p>Please note: if you don&#39;t pay the yearly fee to renew your domain name, you will lose it, and someone else might pick it up&mdash;just like if you don&#39;t pay the phone company, you&#39;ll lose your phone number!</p>
<p>If a lot of people know your website by its domain name, it&#39;s not very nice to let the domain name go sour&mdash;they might not know how to find your information online anymore!</p>

          <p>I&#39;m looking at installing APC (Alternative PHP Cache) on one of the VPS&#39;es I support.</p>
<p>After doing some research, it sounds like it doesn&#39;t play nice with mod_suPHP, which I have installed as well.</p>
<p>Anyone have any experience with those 2?</p>
<p>The VPS - currently - only has 2 websites on it, one is a WordPress site, the other is Joomla.</p>
<p>Also, anyone using a CDN to offload content? Is it pricey</p>

          <p>I am looking for a custom web developer to transform my current website (www.thecatholichour.org) into a custom website based on the Wordpress CMS. The end product will most likely be a custom CMS based on Wordpress as my site will require multiple databases. My original webmaster is too tied up to work within my current timeframe of 2-3 weeks to get essential components up and running followed by a Phase II which will require more customized work on the site.</p>
<p>Here are essential components:</p>
<p>The following feature set would be best for a 1.0 / phase I release:</p>
<p>Video Archive<br />
News Articles Archive<br />
Podcast Archive<br />
Article Archive<br />
Paypal Donate Button<br />
Design Integration with Wordpress<br />
Calendar<br />
Contact Form<br />
MailChimp (newsletter) signup<br />
Basic Buddy Press Configuration<br />
Frontpage customization<br />
My original web developer relayed that Phase I will cost $500 with an estimated 3 week timeline, although some things should be up and running within a couple of days so I can start adding content quickly He said: &quot;After I get the different components in place on the test site I&#39;ll start working up a design and then implementing the design through the various sections of the site. After the design is in place I&#39;ll move onto customizations to the front page and custom page work such as the donate + contact forms.&quot; That sounds reasonable to me.</p>
<p>Phase II - III would contain features such as:</p>
<p>Shopping cart<br />
Map Feature (showing where followers are located, locations of calendar events and locations of local Fulton Sheen Societies)<br />
Interactive Calendar<br />
Buddy Press customization<br />
Fulton Sheen Society subsite (small subsite with diffferent header, top navigation, similar layout to The Catholic Hour)<br />
