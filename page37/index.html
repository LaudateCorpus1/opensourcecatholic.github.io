	From Reuters:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		VATICAN CITY - For God&#39;s sake, blog! Pope Benedict told priests on Saturday, saying they must learn to use new forms of communication to spread the gospel message.</p>
	<p>
		In his message for the Roman Catholic Church&#39;s World Day of Communications, the pope, who is 82 and known not to love computers or the Internet, acknowledged priests must make the most of the &quot;rich menu of options&quot; offered by new technology</p>
	<p>
		&quot;Priests are thus challenged to proclaim the Gospel by employing the latest generation of audiovisual resources &mdash; images, videos, animated features, blogs, Web sites &mdash; which, alongside traditional means, can open up broad new vistas for dialogue, evangelization and catechesis.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		&quot;Pope Benedict XVI urged priests over the weekend to use as many tools as possible to communicate with people, which includes the Internet and&mdash;yes&mdash;blogging. The Pope, who has been a bit of an Internet cudmudgeon, acknowledged that &quot;the larger digital world represents a great resource for humanity&quot; and said priests should take advantage of the tool before they become outdated.&quot;</p>

	Our parish uses the (now, online/OnDemand) Parish Data System (PDS) software, including all facility and event scheduling.&nbsp; We are also about to roll out a new Joomla-based website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Does anyone have a good method for calendar export from PDS?</p>
<p>
	The best I&#39;ve found (with the documentation I&#39;ve had so far) for exporting from PDS is HTML output.&nbsp; I&#39;d rather not have to write a script to use that output to create something a bit more portable (e.g. icalendar).</p>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>
	I&#39;ve been thinking of writing an opensource library that calculates the liturgical calendar.&nbsp; For those of you who are unaware, there is already something out there that calculates one liturgical calendar, <a href="http://www.romcal.net/">Romcal</a>.&nbsp; However, there are many regional variations in the liturgical calendar along with varying solemnities, the Orthodox using the Julian calendar, etc.&nbsp; I was thinking of writing something that could calculate many different calendars and that could be easily customized by the end user for any specific nuances a given region might have.</p>
<p>
	What are peoples&#39; opinions on language choice?&nbsp; I was thinking of keeping it strict ANSI C, which should make creating bindings in various languages fairly easily.&nbsp; I would guess that a library like this would be most beneficial to web developers, but I&#39;d like not to exclude other types of uses such as application programming.</p>
<p>
	My questions are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Does anybody know of anything like this out there already (I like reinventing the wheel as much as the next guy, but there are times when you can go too far...)</li>
	<li>
		With an eye toward aiding web developers, does an ANSI C library seem like a good idea?&nbsp; I say ANSI C because I&#39;m not exactly sure of the nature of SWIG&#39;s support of objects (is there something better than SWIG out there?)</li>
	<li>
		Is this even a good idea?</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br />
	Thanks.</p>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>
	An interesting read about the trend of &#39;marketing&#39; by many Churches (especially those with a bit of fundage, me thinks): <a href="http://www.mattfarina.com/2010/1/why-churches-should-not-market">Why Churches Should Not Market</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Churches put a lot of time and thought into marketing themselves. The church marketing community has grown so large and vast the are even sites that parody what churches do. Some churches have marketing people on staff. And, every year millions and millions of dollars are invested in church marketing.<br />
		<br />
		Yet, I submit that churches should do no marketing. Am I crazy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	My take? We shouldn&#39;t be marketing, but rather <em>evangelizing</em>. Spreading the Gospel message of Jesus Christ. Mercy, sin, pain, anger, death, new life - these are all topics that we can broach when we speak individually with others.</p>
<p>
	The unchurched (those who have never had a faith to call their own, and those who have become too &#39;smart,&#39; &#39;trendy,&#39; or &#39;enlightened&#39; for organized religion) are becoming a greater and greater population. Evangelizing to your own flock, and to other Christians, can only do so much.</p>
<p>
	Through all your actions, you should be considering the lost sheep, as Christ did, first. Leave the 99 be.</p>

	There is no way to absolutely prevent people from using your organizational names, logos, branding, identity, and other copyrighted materials on social network sites (besides creating groups on every social network under every conceivable organization name, which is impractical).<br />
	<br />
	The best way to combat infringements is to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		First, kindly ask the person who made the group to take it down.</li>
	<li>
		Second, ask the social network (most of the big ones have this) to take down the group/account, or at least restrict access, by filing a copyright/infringement claim.<br />
		<a href="http://www.facebook.com/legal/copyright.php">Facebook: Copyright Infringement Policies<br />
		</a><a href="http://help.twitter.com/forums/26257/entries/15795">Twitter: File a copyright or DMCA take-down notice</a></li>
	<li>
		(If it comes to this) File a lawsuit against the social media site, or the individual who created the group/account. This is obviously expensive, and unless you&#39;ve gone through the DMCA claim as stated above, don&#39;t expect to get far with this method.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	It&#39;s a pain, but it&#39;s something we will all need to deal with more often these days...</p>
