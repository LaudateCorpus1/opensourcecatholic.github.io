        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>After reading an article (from Six Revisions) on the <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/resources/the-history-of-the-internet-in-a-nutshell/">History of the Internet</a>, I realized just how cutting-edge our Church has been, historically, when it comes to using the web for communications. The Vatican website (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/">www.vatican.va</a>) was one of the first globally-relevant and vast websites in the world!</p>
<p>The site was built in 1995 as a repository of Church documents, and has since been greatly expanded. However, in this time, pages are getting lost, information is, at best, hard to find, and the generic design has barely changed.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Vatican Website - then and Now" width="527" height="172" src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/then-and-now-vatican-website.jpg" /></p>
<p class="rtecenter">Vatican.va - then (1998) and now. Not much has changed, at least on the surface.</p>
<p>What will it take to bring the Vatican back to the fore of the Internet? Pope Benedict, and Pope John Paul II before him, have repeatedly called for the responsible and widespread use of new communications technology in evangelization and preservation of the Gospel... let's get back on top of the game!</p>
<h3>Steps Towards a Better Website</h3>
<p>What can the Vatican do to get back in the game? Well, here are a few suggestions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Get on a CMS. And make the site truly multi-lingual. Drupal would be a good choice, with it's i18n module. Content should be published in multiple languages quickly and properly-translated.</li>
    <li>Auto-detect the user's region and give him the front page in their own language, with the option of changing languages.</li>
    <li>Put more evangelical information on the front page. A picture of Saint Peter's square doesn't suffice. Have something that will bring a newcomer further into the site (maybe a tie-in to the Vatican Museums?).</li>
    <li>Highlight Papal encyclicals and Church documents; perhaps start a blog for topics covered in the plethora of online documents!</li>
    <li>Get rid of the ugly, 90s-era repeating background image. But keep an elegant, relatively-timeless style.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few of my suggestions &ndash; many more can be had. What do you think?</p>

          <p>Seen on the <a href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0904838.htm">Catholic News Service wire</a>, and <a href="http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com/2009/11/quote-of-day.html">mentioned on Whispers</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- Communications technology keeps changing, but the need to deliver a message with truth and charity is never obsolete, said Italian Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli.<br />
<br />
As president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, Archbishop Celli presided over a four-day meeting of cardinals, bishops and Catholic media professionals to discuss -- mainly in small groups -- new pastoral guidelines for church communications.<br />
<br />
A recurring theme during the meeting Oct. 26-29 was what constitutes Catholic communications and what, if anything, can be done about those who use the word Catholic to describe themselves while using all sorts of nasty adjectives to describe anyone who doesn't agree with them.<br />
<br />
Archbishop Celli said he didn't think a Catholic bloggers' &quot;code of conduct&quot; would accomplish much, especially when what is really needed is a reflection on what it means to communicate.<br />
<br />
Upright, ethical communication is a natural result of a sincere desire to share the truth about God, about faith and about the dignity of the human person, he said.<br />
<br />
The archbishop said that what Pope Benedict XVI has said about solidarity and development aid goes for communications as well: &quot;<strong>Charity needs truth and truth needs charity.</strong>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone speaking publicly as a Catholic has to have those ethical values that are part of a serious, honest form of communication,&quot; Archbishop Celli said.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the past, the church's educational efforts included helping people decide what they should or should not watch. Now it must also help them decide what they should or should not produce&quot; and put on the Internet, he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I think they're trying to say is that we should not use false or inflammatory... or uncharitable kinds of rhetoric and language in what we produce online. I know of many Catholic bloggers and online personality who have struggled with the task of not only tempering their own uncharitable thoughts and words, but also often having to deal with the uncharitable (and often scathing) words of commenters and social media friends/followers.</p>
<p>How are we spreading the Gospel through our work? And are we doing it for Christ, or for our own good/needs/desires/wants?</p>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I spent a bit of time today evaluating text editing on my mac. Honestly, I've just been using text edit (I really only used notepad on Windows), since I don't do much heavy code lifting.</p>
<p>Finally got around to Text Wrangler and have made that my default editor. The line numbers and color coding makes a few things easier.</p>
<p>But...I'm also considering Textmate and Coda (BTW...I do have Dreamweaver CS4, but I don't really like the load time and performance hit with that for simple code editing).</p>
<p>For any other text editing mavens on mac...</p>
<p>What's your preference for a text editor?</p>
<p><i>NOTE: If I'm going to plunk down $ for one, I'd really like it to have 'code completion' ... for instance when I'm in DW, if I'm editing CSS it'll know what my options are for something like 'text-decoration'.</i></p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>As some of you already know, I was a PC for about 15 years (although I was a Mac before that when I worked in the music biz).</p>
<p>When I made the leap to my MacBook Pro about 5 months ago, I figured I'd need to do some virtualization, so I picked up Parallels 4. Just got an email today about the new version 5 ($39), so I read what I could find about it (not much BTW) and went for it.</p>
<p>Very pleased so far! I've got a 2.5Ghz Core 2 Duo with 4GB of RAM and while version 4 was just OK, Parallels 5 is about 50% faster/more responsive and has a slick new viewing mode called &quot;Crystal&quot;...which is really just like coherence mode.</p>
<p>I only have a few apps that I sparingly use in Windows, but the biggest reason I keep it around is for Internet Explorer 6 testing (ugh!) on XP.</p>
<p>When I was a PC, I did A LOT of virtualization (network administration). Created a few virtual servers and also did workstation testing/dev with it.</p>
<p>Couple questions for the aud...</p>
<p>Anyone else do any virtualization? If so, what are you using...and are you happy with it? :)</p>
<p>I did some rudimentary eval of Fusion and wasn't overly impressed...but I didn't spend a whole lot of time with it. It may also be because I converted my Parallels image to Fusion...if I'd have built a new client OS from scratch in Fusion it may have been snappier.&nbsp;</p>
