          <p>[<em>Good post on making a self-published book &mdash;Ed.</em>]</p>
<p>When I&nbsp;began writing a book on the liturgy back in March of this year, I&nbsp;was looking for ways of getting it in print easily and cheaply.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have no funny letters after my name, which means I have received no degrees (or schooling at all, for that matter)&nbsp;in the realm of liturgical studies.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;didn't want that to stop me from getting my research out to the people.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;considered <a href="http://www.lulu.com/"><strong>lulu.com</strong></a> at first, because I had heard good things about it through the Church Music Association of America.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my experience with lulu was plagued by unexplained error messages, customer service that was at least a week behind, and expenses that, while not prohibitive, were disheartening.</p>
<p>It was in the forums on lulu.com that I&nbsp;found out about Amazon.com's print-on-demand division, <a href="http://www.createspace.com/"><strong>CreateSpace.com</strong></a>.&nbsp; Because they are directly connected with Amazon, there is no additional fee for listing the book on Amazon.&nbsp; (The royalties you get through Amazon are less than through the CreateSpace portal, but that's a small price to pay for such visibility.)&nbsp; CreateSpace is barebones when compared to lulu (which provides many additional services, some free, some not), but it was more than sufficient for my needs.&nbsp; The <strong>one</strong> additional expense CreateSpace got me to accept was a one-time $39 fee which results in increased royalties and a reduced price for buying my own book.&nbsp; That $39 will pay for itself in a matter of days.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>In the end, after only <strong>a single day</strong> of having the book in print, I&nbsp;have earned in royalties totalling over 33% of my total expenses in creating and promoting the book.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;would definitely recommend CreateSpace.com to anyone looking to publish a softcover book with minimal hassle and maximum returns-on-investment.</p>
<p>My book, <a href="http://www.prayingthemass.com/"><em>Praying the Mass: The Prayers of the People</em></a>, will be appearing on Amazon.com in a week or two.&nbsp; Until then, it can be purchased through <a href="https://www.createspace.com/3393711">my CreateSpace portal</a>.</p>

          <p>Howdy folks,</p>
<p>At my day gig, we usually post around 25-50 photos a week online with stories. The images are a mixture of those taken by our staff photographer and also a bunch from istockphoto ($$$).</p>
<p>I've been in the habit of keeping all these images each week with the intention of re-using stuff, however a year later I&nbsp;haven't started and the # of images is huge. Nothing has been tagged either.</p>
<p>I'm now planning on tagging all these photos and trying to setup a search index for them...but I'm looking for the right software for the job (open or proprietary).</p>
<p>Would be nice if it's supported by both Mac and Windows and more than one computer can access/share the index.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Craig</p>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>[<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Everything should be operational again. Please let me know if you have any trouble logging in or posting information!]</p>
<p>Well, after a few weeks on Slicehost, I've decided to switch to a different VPS with a company I've grown to like very much&mdash;Hot Drupal&mdash;and consolidate all my sites onto that system (right now my sites are spread across three different hosts).</p>
<p>Some observations after a couple weeks on the Slice:</p>
<ul>
    <li>64-bit OS memory usage makes a large amount of RAM important, especially when running Drupal or another CMS with relatively high memory usage.</li>
    <li>Even with a bunch of optimizations (like using the Boost module or a reverse-proxy http cache), a 256MB slice can feel very limiting&mdash;and that's with just one site running.</li>
    <li>Unless you want to become a bit of a Linux sysadmin (or at least become familiar with the CLI), don't get a slice or linode, or anything of the sort.</li>
    <li>Slices are more for fun and learning (at least on the low end) than for heavy-hitting high-traffic sites... imo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we're moving again, please pardon the dust. In addition, in reference to <a href="/forum/topics/120">this forum topic</a>, I'll be merging Articles and Blogs (eek!) and working to streamline the posting process.</p>

          <p>From the wayback machine: an article that originally appeared in 2005 on Linux.com, written by Marco Fioretti, titled &quot;Free software's surprising sympathy with Catholic doctrine.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The technological configuration underlying the Internet has a considerable bearing on its ethical aspects. Use of the new information technology and the Internet needs to be informed and guided by a resolute commitment to the practice of solidarity in the service of the common good. The Internet requires international cooperation in setting standards and establishing mechanisms to promote and protect [that common good]. Individuals, groups, and nations must have access to these new technologies. Cyberspace ought to be a resource of comprehensive information and services available without charge to all, and in a wide range of languages. The winner in this process will be humanity as a whole and not just a wealthy elite that controls science, technology, and the planet's resources. Determined action in the private and public sectors is needed to close and eventually eliminate the digital divide.&quot;</p>
<p>The above statements sound as if they could have been written by Richard M. Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). In fact, they come from the Vatican Report &quot;Ethics in Internet&quot; (EiI). The FSF position on the same issues is that society &quot;needs information that is truly available to its citizens -- for example, programs that people can read, fix, adapt, and improve, not just operate.&quot;</p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.linux.com/archive/articles/49533">Continue reading...</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his article, Mr. Fioretti makes many points about the relationship of sound Catholic doctrine and open source software development. He includes arguments supported by many official Church documents, including <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_26031967_populorum_en.html">Populorum Progressio</a>, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/pccs/documents/rc_pc_pccs_doc_23051971_communio_en.html">Communio et Progressio</a>, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091981_laborem-exercens_en.html">Laborem exercens</a>, and <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/pccs/documents/rc_pc_pccs_doc_20020228_church-internet_en.html">The Church and the Internet</a>.</p>
<p>A few interesting points made in the article:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Catholic Church <strong>should not use proprietary file formats</strong> and computer protocols, since they can become a way to prevent access to information, restrict it or lock end users to any specific (maybe too expensive) software program.</li>
    <li>The Catholic Church should work to allow open and free access to any and all information the faithful have a right to know, and doing so could involve (among other things):
    <ul>
        <li>Adopting the Free international standard OpenDocument for office documents in all Catholic institutions worldwide.</li>
        <li>Avoiding proprietary file formats and protocols on Catholic Web sites and in official Church documents, and not accepting them in any official communication.</li>
        <li>Making sure that all Catholic Web sites are certified as <strong>viewable with any browser</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think? I've seem my fair share of Word documents, Publisher documents, and Microsoft lock-in in pretty much every corner of the Church I'm involved with... And it's also sad when I find software/websites break in non-Microsoft non-Internet Explorer environments.</p>
