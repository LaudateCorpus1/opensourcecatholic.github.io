          <p>Before this century, most event organizers would use many hours of data collection, tabulation, and payment processing time to prepare for a large (or even a small) event.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re looking for more comprehensive solutions for donor management, online customer/parishioner relations management, etc., you may want to tak a look at <a href="/node/361">CRM, Donation Reception, Online Payments</a>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there is a wide variety of options when it comes to online event planning, registration, coordination, and management. If you want to simply collect data from a certain population, either for a registration or for other purposes, there are many simple ways to do that (some are even built into online content management systems like Drupal and Wordpress).</p>
<p>If you want to dig deeper and allow for much more fine-grained data collection and management of event attendees, or even sell tickets with different levels of discounts and privileges, you can do that pretty easily as well.</p>
<p>This section of the Wiki looks at different options for online registration, forms, and event and ticketing payments.</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Many organizations are looking to alleviate a lot of the stress and hours of work that comes with managing event registrations. Instead of dealing with hundreds or thousands of mailed-in registration forms, checks, cash, and manual credit card transactions, your organization can benefit from using an online event registration and management system.</p>
<p>These systems often perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic data collection (like other <a href="/wiki/basic-data-collection-onl">form builders</a>)</li>
<li>Payment processing (either through your own bank, a service like PayPal, or directly via credit card transactions)</li>
<li>Advanced registration management and data analysis</li>
<li>Customized form interfaces</li>
<li>Optional integration with your own website</li>
</ul>
<p>These systems typically charge a small fee per registration, and some may have a monthly or yearly subscription fee. Typically these services are best for those holding events with more than a few participants and where individuals must pay more than five or so dollars to register.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the best online event registration systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://doattend.com/">DoAttend</a></strong> - Pretty easy to use, and allows for e-ticketing. No monthly fees, and free for small/non-profit events.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.eventarc.com/">EventArc</a></strong> - Relatively easy to use, and has an impressive &#39;used by&#39; list. Again, free for small/non-profit events.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a></strong> - This service has been around longer, but it&#39;s not quite as easy to use as some newer services. However, it is very robust.</li>

	Do you just need to collect information from a certain group of people? You can do this quite simply using a &#39;form builder,&#39; which allows you to set the information people are required to submit. Once a person submits his information, the form that is built will do one or both of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Send you an email with all of the submitted information.</li>
	<li>
		Store the submitted information in a database for easy viewing, editing, or exporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Here are some of the simplest (and often most inexpensive) form building tools:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/">Survey Monkey</a></strong> - One of the oldest, and easiest ways to quickly build a form. Simple forms are free, and you can sign up for a pro account with more features. Doesn&#39;t require any changes to your own website.</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="http://wufoo.com/">WuFoo</a></strong> - A newer site/service that allows you to create forms very easily, and even offers more advanced features like PayPal payment integration. Doesn&#39;t require any changes to your own website.</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="http://drupal.org/project/webform">Webform</a></strong> - A free Drupal module for form building that is very easy to use and can be extended in many ways, but requires a Drupal website to run.</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="http://www.forms-for-joomla.com/">Forms for Joomla</a></strong> - An easy-to-use form builder for Joomla-based websites, similar to Webform, but costing over $20.</li>
</ul>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>
	From a paper I read recently:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Based on the observation that users did not use a number of support functions, such as the medical notes and the consultation review interface, future trials will include a short tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	The authors are talking about a <a href="duboc.me/en/category/tags/phd" lang="en" title="PhD project: semantic virtual patient">virtual patient system</a>, but this probably applies to many applications. If users didn&#39;t use certain functions, in my book there can be two reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		The features are not well designed, and users don&#39;t know how to access them or,</li>
	<li>
		They don&#39;t actually need the features.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Either way, the right solution is probably not to bombard users with tutorials, but rather to do some proper user tests and redesign or eliminate useless features (or even better, not bother to build them at all. Duh. Life is too short for useless code).</p>
<p>
	I&#39;d say that&#39;s how bad software is built. What&#39;s your opinion?</p>

          <p>
	During this Easter season, I saw fit to spend a few hours on the OSC website, which has, I admit, taken a back seat to many of my other web projects, most notably the <a href="http://archstl.org/">Archdiocese of St. Louis website</a> and some other little projects I&#39;m dabbling in (like an experimental <a href="http://jeffgeerling.com/">HTML5 site</a>).</p>
<p>
	Here are some of the recent changes I&#39;ve made:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="/tweets/all">OSC Member Tweets</a> are back online!</strong><br />
		(I Installed an updated version of Drupal&#39;s Twitter module. Cron is now much faster, and old Tweets are cleared from the database, so I feel save using the module again).</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="/book/open-source-catholic-wiki">OSC Wiki Pages</a> are being added!</strong> (and anyone with an account can edit them!)<br />
		(Right now they&#39;re pretty sparse, but I plan on taking on the development of these pages as a personal project&mdash;mostly so I can have a nice resource to refer the poor helpless chaps that are burdened with parish/diocesan web development, but need help).</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Theming Issues are being cleaned up!</strong><br />
		(I&#39;ve spent a little more time working with the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/airyblue">Airy Blue</a> theme (on drupal.org) and fixing small theming issues I&#39;ve found on OSC, in particular).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	BUT, most importantly, <strong>the &#39;Beta&#39; status of this site has been removed</strong>! I figure almost a year into the site&#39;s existence, it is time. Check out the new and improved (and 5 KB lighter) header at the top of this page!</p>
<p>
	Any other suggestions? Comments are welcome :)</p>
