        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p class="documentDescription">The Catholic Semantic Web is a network of resources and tools to provide computer intelligent services.</p>

<h2>THE SEMANTIC WEB IS THE FUTURE</h2>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee who created the internet all those years ago is head of the <span class="link-external"><a href="http://w3c.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a></span> which sets the standards and direction for the internet. The Sematic web IS the future direction of the web and as the above quote highligts, involves ‘automated tools’ ie articifical intelligence. To get a better understanding of this technology, you may like to read the various articles on the <span class="link-external"><a href="http://w3c.org/2001/sw/">Semantic web page</a></span> at w3c, such as <span class="link-external"><a href="http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/12614/01/Semantic_Web_Revisted.pdf">‘Semantic Web Revisited’</a></span>.</p>

<p>The semantic web is based on a variety of technologies including XML, Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>EXtensible Markup Language (XML), is a meta-standard that provides a framework to interconnect information about information. HTML expresses how information should look, eg <strong>bold</strong>, XML expresses what the information actually is, eg an address. To correctly interpret information, there needs to be a way to correctly connect information about information, eg a person has an address, a person is male or female. There are various technologies that address these issues, such as <span class="link-external"><a href="http://w3c.org/RDF/">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a></span> which is a particluar XML standard.</p>

<p>Once information is correctly ‘marked-up’ it needs to be interpreted, this processing is called natural language processing which seeks to interpret natural languages such as English. There are various processes that are part of nlp, such as recognising the part-of-speech of a word, eg verb, adjective, noun. Another one is to be able to correctly connect words, ie grammar, eg subject, object, adjectival phrase. There are several versions of these tools available freely, such as <span class="link-external"><a href="http://gate.ac.uk/">‘General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE)</a></span>.</p>

<p>Tools such as GATE give limited artificial intelligence, but future tools will reach beyond processing. The future is being realised now and these tools are being used in many ways already.</p>

<h2>CURRENT CHRISTIAN EFFORTS</h2>

<p>Christians are already utilising this technology. The Bible Society is developing a XML namespace for scripture. The Christian Classics Etheral Library (CCEL) has developed a <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.ccel.org/ThML/">Theological XML</a></span> (Thml) . The Bible Technologies Group has created a XML schema for scripture, commentaries and related texts called <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.bibletechnologies.net/">Open Scriptural Information Standard</a></span> (OSIS) . Already various projects are underway to make use of this standard, such as  <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.crosswire.org/sword/about/index.jsp">Open Source Bible Software</a></span> . In a similar way, Catholics would be able to develop Catechetical software resources if there was a Catechism XML.</p>

<h2>CATHOLIC EFFORTS</h2>

<p>The Vatican has already invested in this technology through the use of ETML. The vatican site has some markup on some documents eg <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0217/3E.HTM.">http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0217/3E.HTM.</a></span> This development comes from  <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.intratext.com/">http://www.intratext.com/</a></span> which uses the technology from <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.eulogos.net/">http://www.eulogos.net/</a></span> Most of the site is not in English, you could use google translate to read it in English.</p>

<p>Cathnet is dedicated to the Catholic development of this technology and already one of our members has used the OSIS standard to markup the Catechism. Contact us if you want to know more.</p>

<h2>CATECHISM XML (C3ML)</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/project/resources/c3mlflyer.doc">C3ML</a> (Catechism of the Catholic Church Markup Language) is a XML for the Catechism. There is already a <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.bibletechnologies.net/">XML for scripture</a></span>, why not for the Catechism?</p>

<h3>WHAT WOULD CATECHISM XML DO?</h3>

<p>The Catechism is the key official document that spans Catholic theology. C3ML would provide the Standard upon which powerful computer applications would be able to provide superior sharing, accessibility, linking and referencing of catechetical resources. C3ML as a standard would provide a common means of sharing these resources across disparate groups in the Church.</p>

<p>A Catechism XML would provide an organisational principle that can categorise other Catholic documents. This would be a key component in a Catholic namespace. As an international standard, resources in different languages would be commonly linked and therefore available.</p>

<h3>BENEFITS</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Interoperability Church related documents will be able to be shared through the developing technologies and portals being created as well as across languages.</li>
	<li>Accessibility Document searches will be far more accurate and will have very little erroneous material.</li>
	<li>Linking Relationships between documents will be clearer and thus allowing for better navigation. Navigation will be able to follow the ideas within the documents with greater accuracy, rather than trying to find related documents and then having to find the ideas within a document.</li>
	<li>Reference Any document that refers to a particular Catechism paragraph can be found and only those documents will be listed.</li>
	<li>Integration Allow integration in new technologies such as Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Representation Tools.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>THE ULTIMATE VISION</h2>

<p>The ultimate would be a RDF of the Catechism that could automatically catalogue any catholic web resource and provide automatic referencing of the catechism for documents. This could then be extended to all documents in the Vatican repository. If the Catechism were to be corretly marked up into a corpus, ie a tag set that correctly references every word and how that word relates to others in the sentence, and document. This is beyond a phD project! this document can then be used by NLP tools to far more accuratly markup other theological documents and thus provide a great service to the theological world and would bring theology into the semantic web. These NLP tools can then with a far higher degree of accuracy index theological documents according to the structure of the Catechism and in a way to theological structure itself, since the Catechism covers the core of Catholic theology and is a definitive document and thus THE mechanism par excellence for this purpose. </p>

<p>Once this is achieved, a sample application would be realtime Catechism referencing. Imagine you are typing a theological document, as you type your system is correlating what you are typing with C3ML and when it finds a high correlation it suggests a quote from the Catechism that is applicable and offers to footnote that quote or include if for you. Imagine if the whole vatican library was available this way? Imagine if the whole Catholic internet was availble this way? … this gives you some idea of the potential of the Catholic Semantic Web.</p>

<p>Another application is autmatically concept mapping the Catechism. To read about this a proposal that explains this is available <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/project/resources/acmc.doc">here</a></span>.</p>

Catechism RDF is a key component of the Catholic Semantic Web. The world wide web consortium is leading the web into the Semantic web.
"The Semantic Web is an extension of the current Web in which information is given well-defined meaning, enabling computers and people to work in better cooperation. The Web will reach its full potential when it becomes an environment where data can be shared and processed by automated tools as well as by people." - Tim Berners-Lee and Eric Miller

The automated tools mentioned by Tim and Eric have a level of AI, where they can process human text. A&nbsp; quick look through the following links will alert the reader to the potential and importance of such tools

<span class="link-external"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing at Wikipedia:</a></span> <strong>Natural language processing (NLP)</strong> is a subfield of <span class="link-external"><a title="Artificial intelligence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a></span> and <span class="link-external"><a title="Linguistics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics">linguistics</a></span>. It studies the problems of automated generation and understanding of <span class="link-external"><a title="Natural language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language">natural human languages</a></span>. Natural language generation systems convert information from computer databases into normal-sounding human language, and natural language understanding systems convert samples of human language into more formal representations that are easier for computer programs to manipulate.
<span class="link-external"><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/nlp/">
Natural Language Processing at Microsoft:</a></span> The goal of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) group is to design and build software that will analyze, understand, and generate languages that humans use naturally, so that eventually you will be able to address your computer as though you were addressing another person.

<span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/natlang.html">Natural Language Processing at American Association for Artificial Intelligence</a></span>: The value to our society of being able to communicate with computers in everyday "natural" language cannot be overstated. Imagine asking your computer "Does this candidate have a good record on the environment?" or "When is the next televised National League baseball game?" Or being able to tell your PC "Please format my homework the way my English professor likes it." Commercial products can already do some of these things, and AI scientists expect many more in the next decade. One goal of AI work in natural language is to enable communication between people and computers without resorting to memorization of complex commands and procedures. Automatic translation---enabling scientists, business people and just plain folks to interact easily with people around the world---is another goal. Both are just part of the broad field of AI and natural language, along with the cognitive science aspect of using computers to study how humans understand language.

Is it possible to talk theologically with a computer? Yes, but not yet. The tools to perform such a function are already being developed as you can see by following the above links. What is needed is for them to know Catholic Theology. What is needed is Catechism RDF.

Catechism RDF

XML ( eXtensible Markup Language) describes what something is, eg Fr. John is a Priest (&lt;priest&gt;Fr. John&lt;/priest&gt;). RDF descibes the relationship between words, eg Fr. John is the Parish priest of St. John's. It would look something like:

<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
             xmlns:catholic="http://vatican.va/ns/catholic#"&gt;

  &lt;catholic:Person rdf:about="http://melbourne.catholic.org.au/People/JohnSmith/"&gt;
    &lt;catholic:fullName&gt;John Smith&lt;/catholic:fullName&gt;
    &lt;catholic:religious&gt;priest&lt;/catholic:religious&gt;
    &lt;catholic:parish&gt;St. John's&lt;/catholic:parish&gt;
  &lt;/catholic:Person&gt;

&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</pre>

It is clear that in this instance, we have a simple and clear meaning for each of these words. When it comes to a document like the catechism, there are far more complexities.
Words can have more than one meaning, eg 'The invalid had an invalid ticket'. Words translated from one language will have different meanings in another, eg the Greek word 'anouthen' (Jn 3:3) normally translated 'again', also can mean 'from above'. So there is a loss of meaning when translated from one translation to another. Then there is the decision of which meaning is intended in a particular circumstance. St. John may have intended both, thus different translations focus on different meanings. These are just some of the issues with converting a text into a computer readable format.

The Catholic Catechism is in three important languages, French (which was the draft text), Latin (which is an official text) and English which is the text used in the English speaking world. Catechism RDF will need to take into account the matrix of meanings as well as the different sentence structures.

STEPS NEEDED

The standards provided by w3c.org for RDF and OWL provide a starting point. Ultimately the Catechism RDF will be expressed in that format.
A common markup of the Catechism using a particular tag set will need to be completed on each language version. This is a project in an off itself. Each markup up text can then be expressed in a RDF and then OWL.</div>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/2012/the-importance-of-mobile-for-the-church">The Importance of Mobile for the Church</a>
        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p><img src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/Jeff%20Geerling/vatican-website-iphone.png" alt="Vatican Website on the iPhone" width="253" height="475" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" />By 2015 (probably sooner), more people in the world will be accessing Church websites with mobile devices than traditional desktop computers (<a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1510">source</a>).</p>

<p>Most Catholic websites (including this one, currently) are designed only for traditional desktop computer displays, and look either atrocious or (at best) hard to read on mobile devices.</p>

<p><strong>This is a major problem.</strong></p>

<p>It’s not good enough to simply be present on the web anymore; the Catholic Church—once a leader in the arts, science and technology research, etc.—has fallen far behind on the Internet. The <a href="http://www.vatican.va/">Vatican’s website</a>, once one of the only public websites on the Internet, is now a relic of the past, being difficult to navigate and read not only on mobile devices, but even on desktop computers.</p>

<p>Most diocese-level websites have a design aesthetic straight from the late 90s, and parish-level websites are beyond that. Many in the Church say “the 90s isn’t that long ago…”, but they don’t realize that for the new generation of youth who are now maturing into adulthood, an ugly and hard-to-use website is the equivalent of locking the doors to your church during daytime hours so they can’t come in and pray (which, sadly, many Catholic parishes <em>also</em> do).</p>

<p>Many parishes don’t even have a website, much less a website that’s designed to be easy to use for mobile users. Even if a parish just had a page that listed the parish name, had a picture of the parish, a map link, a phone number, and Mass Times (and <em>nothing more</em>), it’d be better than about half the parish websites that exist today. And it would probably work better on mobile browsers.</p>

<p>An article posted recently to CatholicTechTalk.com asks, <a href="http://catholictechtalk.com/2012/06/05/is-your-church-website-mobile-enabled-2/">is your church website mobile-enabled?</a> I would ask, more pointedly, is your church website designed for mobile users? (I would even say that it would be better to design only for mobile users than only for traditional desktop users, at this point).</p>

<h3>What to Avoid</h3>

<p>To make sure your website is at least at a base level of mobile-friendliness, here are some things you should try to avoid—especially on your site’s home page:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Complexity.</strong>
Complexity kills performance, confuses users, and even makes it harder for you to manage your own site. Don't include something in navigation unless it's really important, and cut down on the features/add-ons you add to your site (especially on the front page).</li>
	<li><strong>Adobe Flash. For anything. Get rid of it.</strong>
Most devices won't show it at all, and those few that do, render Flash poorly and/or slowly. (Same goes for Silverlight, Java, or other plugin-based content).</li>
	<li><strong>Large image backgrounds and other large images.</strong>
Mobile devices are often used over 3G connections, and even newer 4G connections are nowhere near as fast or reliable as home broadband. Don't make mobile users wait for a minute to load your website—they won't wait, they'll just close the window and leave.</li>
	<li><strong>Things that require mouse-based interaction.</strong>
Really detailed image maps should not be used, as they're difficult for a touch-based user to touch. Also, some forms of menus (like mega menus) should be well-tested on touchscreen devices before they're deployed.</li>
	<li><strong>Script-heavy pages.</strong>
If you have a lot of JavaScript logic (or jQuery/whatever library you use), mobile devices often spend 5-10x longer than desktops processing the logic. Keep that in mind when you decide to use 35 different JS effects on a page!&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h3>What to Foster</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Simplicity.</strong>
One of the greatest challenges of my job redesigning the Archdiocese of St. Louis' website was reducing the clutter on the front page; cutting down links, showing only a few items, etc. Sometimes it's hard to cut clutter, but think of exactly what site visitors want, and focus only on that. As a side effect, your website will load faster and be easier to read.</li>
	<li><strong>Responsive and/or mobile-first design.</strong>
It's not too hard to turn a simple design into a responsive design, which looks good on a variety of devices (think iPhone, iPad, Kindle Fire, Laptop, Desktop, TV, etc.). Here's a quick guide I wrote <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/making-your-current-drupal">for Drupal themes</a>. A good book to get you started is here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005SYWGXW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwmidw06-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005SYWGXW">Responsive Web Design</a>. Check out an <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/blog/2012/life-a-prayer-looking-great">example of responsive design</a> (resize your browser window or view it on a mobile phone).</li>
	<li><strong>Fewer resources.</strong>
If possible, try combining small JavaScript files or multiple CSS files into one. Use preprocessors and minification tools (like <a href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/uglifyjs">UglifyJS</a>) to make resources much smaller in size. It takes mobile devices much longer to download resources (especially when there are many) than desktop computers.</li>
	<li><strong>Front-end performance.</strong>
A lot of people spend hours worrying about optimizing MySQL to gain 100ms on the server processing a page, or optimizing a PHP function to save 10ms. Did you know that most of the time spent rendering a page these days actually takes place on the user's device (especially with mobile devices, which are many times slower than the fastest desktops on which you're developing your website!). Read this article for more info: <a href="http://drupalwatchdog.com/1/2/big-performance-wins-on-front-end">Big Performance Wins on the Front End</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Not There Yet</h3>

<p>I’m giving these bits of advice to fellow Catholic web developers; unfortunately, most that I know are overworked, don’t get paid enough by Catholic institutions to justify spending time helping make a site mobile-friendly, or can’t spend their free time trying to help often stubborn Catholic institutions to join the 21st century web.</p>

<p>Sadly, then, most of these words are going to fall on deaf ears. But the Church and Catholic organizations need to seriously consider whether they want to court an entire generation of web users who will have only a mobile phone and maybe something like an iPad, or ignore them and focus only on a bygone time of the web. Bulletins, mailings, and phone calls aren’t cutting it today, and they won’t cut it in the future.</p>

<p>Personal contact—one of the things at which the Church is a pro—isn’t a given these days, and the Church needs to court people in any avenue possible, especially online. Let’s clean out our welcome mats (our websites), and make our entrances more inviting. Welcome people through technology, and then make a personal connection.</p>

<p>Just wanted to post information about the <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/2012/05/21/cnmc-tech-summit-announced/">Tech Summit</a> that will be held on August 29 at the <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/">2012 Catholic New Media Celebration</a>. The CNMC will be held in Dallas/Fort Worth, and I’ll be there along with a bunch of other Catholic web and app developers, talking about new apps and development, API integration, and the future of tech in the Church.</p>

<p>I’m hoping you’ll come too!</p>

<p>All the pertinent info about the Tech Summit can be found <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/2012/05/21/cnmc-tech-summit-announced/">here</a>, and you can register for the conference today! Come and contribute to our discussions about things like the open-source <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/project/catholic-diocese-app">Catholic Diocese app</a>, next-generation Catholic APIs and data sharing, and how we can work together to advance the Church’s use of technology, most especially on the web and on mobile devices.</p>

<p>“With the help of a dedicated volunteer, who has been working hard
converting the encyclicals to eReader formats, the Papal Encyclicals
Online now has hundreds of papal encyclicals in both MOBI and EPUB
formats. So far, we have most of the available documents of the Popes
from Honorious III (1216 A.D.) through Pope Leo XIII (1903 A.D.)
completed.”</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>For some time, developers on Open Source Catholic have been working on formalizing a standard for sharing Catholic Parish directory information online through a universal XML format, in the thread <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/forum/topics/346">Sharing Parish Directory Information Online</a>.</p>

<p>We are still in the early development stages of this format, and we would love your help and discussion in that thread. Below is the latest work on the format, which is changing rapidly. Until we have a set standard, consider the information on this page to be in early alpha stages.</p>

<p>A Drupal module to incorporate this format into a parish or diocese’s Drupal website is currently being written: <a href="http://drupal.org/project/parish_info">Parish Info</a> (part of the <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/project/open-parish-website">Open Parish Initiative</a>).</p>

Some notes on this format:

<ul>
<li>lastUpdated date is in ISO 8601 format</li>
<li>The ID might not be known to the parish at the time the parish creates its information. Somehow we'll need the central server to designate a unique ID for each parish...</li>
<li>We'll need a standard format/list of Rites, Dioceses (see <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/wiki/117/php-array-list-all-united">PHP Array of Dioceses</a>), event types, etc.</li>
<li>Many attributes/fields are or should be optional or can be left empty (like geolocation, address line 2, phone, fax, and email...).</li>
</ul>
